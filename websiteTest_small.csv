Books_5,5.0,CG,"I loved this book. I have read all the other books in the series, and this one is a keeper. The story is well told, the characters are interesting, and the story is well told. I would highly recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. I love a good mystery with a good twist. I have read all of the other books in the series. This one is a little different and I am not sure why I didn't give it a five star rating. I would have liked it a little better. I just didn't get it. It is definitely a book I will read again."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,This is my third pair.  I wear the knee pads for a lot of work and this one is a little too tight.  The sleeves are too tight and the inside of the pants is too tight.  It's a little difficult to get them in and out of the way.  I'm a big guy and I'm very satisfied with the quality of these pads.I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in. This gun is super light and easy to carry. The gun fits nicely in my pack and holds a lot of ammo. I would definitely recommend this gun to anyone.Very good product. Very good quality.Great quality. Love it!Easy to install. I have no problems with this. I have had this on my Trek Trek
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,CG,This one just didn't hit the mark. It just wasn't as good as the first one. I had a lot of fun with this one. It was very entertaining and it was well written. I'm looking forward to reading the next one. The author does a great job with the descriptions of the animals and the locations. It is a well written book. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read about animals and a good way to have fun. I really enjoyed reading this book.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Michael Morpurgo did a wonderful job of portraying WW I through the horse's eyes, giving us, once again the view of the war from both the eyes of all affected by the War. Loved all the language and the landscapes, and I totally bought into the people surrounding this wonderful horse. My one very small issue came at the end, where the author seemed to be compressing rather than extending the tail (no pun intended!) of the story. I do know that you don't want to overstay a solution, but racing makes for a predictably succinct summary, rather than a full bodied landing. Love Michael Morpurgo's writing, and have always enjoyed watching kids work their way through with a real spirit of curiosity."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I sue these dogs beds as a liner for my dog's cots.  This is what I was looking for to place on top of the dog cots so they are not laying on the rougher mesh surface of the cot.  They fit the large cots well.  They are a too thin to use alone as a dog bed.  They fit well in a large wire kennel but they are still a little to thin for comfort for my older dogs.  I have not washed them but I tumble them in the dryer to freshen, fluff and remove dog hair."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very preliminary review. I'm a little miffed that I'm even writing it. Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!! I will buy more of these units until all in my home are replaced. 4 so far but have a half dozen or so to go in the next weeks/months assuming I don't find issues. Love the nightlight, btw."

Books_5,5.0,CG,"This book leaves me with a feeling of being lost in the world.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed.  The main character, a young American boy named Nicholas, is not the typical kid.  Instead, he is a young man who is raised by a strong family.  He is a very special person, and it is his family that makes him special.  The main character, Dr. Michael, is a scientist, and he is also a strong character.  When he learns of the death of his"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very dense bone that is 5.5 inches long by about 2 inches wide.  My 80 lb greyhound loves it.  It's almost too big for him.  I do think it cleans his teeth because he has to work so hard gnawing at it to get even the tiniest chunk to come off the end.  He only gets through about half of this bone before he's full and tired.  Then I remove it and save it for the next day.  The 4 stars are because it's messy.  It leaves orangish debris on his bed that is sticky and gross, in my opinion, not his :-)  He'd give it a 10."

I enjoyed this story although it was too short.  The author drew the reader in and allowed us to experience the emotions of her characters.  The story was just a clean sweet romance story."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I thought this was pretty great when I got it. But I have reconsidered. Stick blender cracked shortly after I got it, although it still worked. It has a (horrendous - for me) protective cover over the blades which is often in the way. The stick part really needs to be put in the dishwasher to clean it. I think that the problem is that it does too many things, and lacks the simplicity of a standard sort of stick blender. Also, the 'stick' attaches awkwardly to the motor. Mine just broke. The old standard one which I gave away worked forever.

OTOH, it is powerful, and if you don't mind the hooded blades might be just the thing."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Excellent book! Being a parent is never an easy job, it comes with great responsibility on how we are going to deal with it. This book gives you insights and advises on how to face the challenges of being a parent and on how you are going to deal with your kid's personalities and characters in the right manner for them to become responsible of their own actions. Communication is a lot needed to understand each other, too, it is a give and take relationship. We should learn to listen and connect with them and even become a child if needed, that way we will be able to understand them. Be fun and creative! I highly recommend this book!"

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.
Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards.
Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.
Lifted egg out, pan was clean."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"The movie contains all of the expected elements of the ""Biblical Epic""; just don't expect too many facts. The story as told is interesting and the camera work is at spectacle level. The chariot race (yes, I said ""chariot race"") has the same nail-biting element as it's name-sake. Smile. Quite enjoyable."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"Well I have to say, it's a very comfortable collar.  My dog loves to scratch.  The clasp is a nice design.  The dog is tall so it's easy to put on and off.  The clasp is very sturdy.  I don't have to worry about getting a bit loose because I can keep it on and off and on with the leash.  I love the fact that it's a little bit big for my dog and a little wide for her.  I also like that the clasp is adjustable so I can adjust it without pulling the dog.  It's also easy to adjust the collar so it fits nicely in my hand.  I love the fact that it's lightweight and I don't have to worry about pulling my dog's neck.  I've worn it a little longer than I thought it would be because I didn't want her pulling on it too hard.  She's a very picky eater"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,I am currently deployed and I was excited to receive these but when I did I was quite disappointed. The inside bottom sole of the right shoe is lifted from the bottom of the shoe and not fully glued on. I can lift half of it off. I'm nervous to wear these because I feel that the inside will get worn pretty fast and start sliding and coming out easily oppose to if it were made and glued down properly. I tried them on for a brief minute to see if the sizing was good and that was fine so no complaints there. Still not sure what to do with these. I'm really debating on sending them back but the process to do so from overseas is a little difficult.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"These books are a 3.5 star read the charters are great and the plot is pretty good but my god it was boring it's basically sex scene after sex scene there's no real depth to it and when they aren't having sex it's the same ""internal"" thoughts over and over again the most interesting part is the 2 pages that were Henry's  POV reading his portion made it seem like the story was going to pick up but didn't and the intrigue the author tried to build died a quick death when it was reveled and ended up being nothing of importance even to Monica when he told her towards the end it did get a bit interesting then again faded the last in 80% of it I so wished these books would've been more interesting I want to fall asleep just thinking about them"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.  If that changes, I will update my review.  Now the only thing remaining is the longevity of this device.  It looks built to last, so I hope it is.  This is a great product."
Books_5,4.0,CG,Really liked this book a lot. The characters were well developed and the plot was well written. The story was told very well.

But I love this one.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I hate ordering clothing online, but I took a chance on these and I'm so happy I did!  These are incredibly comfortable and stylish (although the top is an elastic band, so I wouldn't recommend wearing with a short top)  I haven't been able to get rid of my mommy tummy and regular pants were cutting right into it, creating the muffin top and I was really self-conscious about it.  These pants stay in place and keep their shape really well, so I don't have to keep pulling them up and they don't stretch out while I'm wearing them, so no butt sag.  And they really do a great job of keeping my tummy looking flat, but without pinching.  These really are the perfect pants!  I'm currently a size 6 and I could have gone down to a 4 in these, so keep that in mind.  They have a standard inseam, but they're a little short on me, so if you have long legs, also keep that in mind.  I've recommended these to all my friends and I'll be buying more in the future."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I bought this for my Siberian Husky puppy. I LOVE the pink color because it is bright and really stands out in the water. Our pup took to swimming so quickly that we only use this life jacket when we go kayaking. It is so easy to put on and really easy to adjust to a growing dog. I love how i can use the two top straps to pick up my dog and everything stays in place and she isn't uncomfortable. I did a lot of research before buying and I really believe this is the best and most stylish life jacket out there!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"If you can lift furniture high enough to get this product under it, you can lift it high enough to put a furniture slider under it.  I guess if you have some furniture that has a lip on it...  I found it worthless for the furniture I was trying to move.  I am a 49 yr of female who was helping my parents (mid to late 70s) move some office furniture in order to paint a room.  Since there was no lip, I just barely lifted the furniture enough for them to slide a furniture sliders underneath each corner.  I returned this for refund- it was useless to me."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"The Bottoms Up was difficult for us, probably because of the 65 pound weight of our dog. I imagine it would be much easier with a smaller dog. Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I'm a 6'2 240 pound amateur bodybuilder. I ordered this for an alternative cardio method living here in South Florida and as a fishing platform. To be clear I use this solo as the single seater was too small and I exceed the weight limit.

First impressions it's not exactly portable long distances. It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.

It actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.

The perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.

Only complaint is I wish it had a collapsible fiberglass rod or 2 like a tent to give some stability to the hull."

It is between ""Lady Killer"" and ""Smart Money""  as follows. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter stars Alan Arkin as John Singer, who is deaf. Singer moves from a small town in order to be close to his institutionalized deaf and mentally impaired friend Antonapoulos (Chuck McCann). Singer rents a room with a family whose father, Mr. Kelly (Biff McGuire), is unable to earn a living due to a serious injury. His teen-aged daughter Mick (Sondra Locke, in her film debut) is at first resentful of Singer's presence, but he ingratiates himself by introducing her to classical music (which he can ""feel,"" if not hear). Singer likewise tries to brighten the lives of such unfortunates as alcoholic Blount (Stacy Keach Jr. , also making his first film appearance), dying black doctor Copeland (Percy Rodriguez), and Copeland's poverty-stricken daughter (Cicely Tyson). ??????????
