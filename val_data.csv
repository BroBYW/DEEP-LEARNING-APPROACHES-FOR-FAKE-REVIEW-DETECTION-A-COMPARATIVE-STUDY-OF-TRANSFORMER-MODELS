Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"I have other pairs of this. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the TRS-4 and it does not fit well. It does not stay in place. If you are looking for a good shoe with a strong shoe, this is the shoe for you.I ordered a second set of these gloves. They are great, but I wish they had an on/off switch. They are not very comfortable for me, so I'm going to leave them in the kids room. I was just getting them off the box and put them on. They are a little too big for my hands. They do work well for my wrists, but they are too small for my hands. They are also too small for my hands. I would have liked to have used a larger pair. I wish they had a on/off switch. I have the 4-5 inch wrist. They are very comfortable. They fit my wrists well and I am very happy with them. They are made of a high quality"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We use these ""liners"" as litter boxes, scoop daily (using a litter genie to collect the clumps) and after 4-6 weeks we toss the whole thing, and start all over again.  It's really made the litter box area more sanitary.  Before we switched to this 'system' I never felt like the litter area was clean enough.  This helps.  The cats seem pleased too."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,This harness worked out great foy both my beagles.  I purchased this one for my girl beagle and one in red for my boy.  I've had them for almost 5 months now and with constant wear they're still going strong.  There's a lot of adjustment room and both dogs are very comfortable in them.  Great product and great price!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"It took several different sandals to find the perfect one for our trip later this year to southern Italy (as in, hot!). But these are the ones. As others have said, it's incredibly adjustable, and that is a major plus.  I was looking for a leather sole as I think that's more comfortable when doing a lot of walking, especially when it's hot.  This sole has great support (I think I have a medium arch).  The strap design works well and is really attractive. I LOVE the ""Vintage Silver"" color - it's actually a mix of subtle silver/gold/bronze shades, and has some sheen but in a rich way. Should go well with daytime vacation clothes while being OK with slightly dressier evening travel wear-"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"Like others have said, the stitching is right down the middle of your face so it rides on your nose and lips.  Not that big of a deal once your busy riding the slopes but could be perfect if not for that flaw.  Kept my face fairly warm, for the price it works but would spend an extra $5 next time for better design."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I used this to protect a 7 inch Santoku knife. But I never felt that this guard was very securely on. Even cut my finger once when inserting the knife because the knife edge passed through the top of the guard and my finger was there.

I highly recommend that you get a sheath/cover/saya which completely enlcoses the blade."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,Returned it as the webbing started peeling off after one use.
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"It should have worked, because It's a fun idea, but it falls painfully flat. It's hard to imagine Michael York as a serious seducer for one, and two, Angela Lansbury gives a performance that suggests that she is on a stage. It was a box office disaster, and you can see why. Harold Prince was a great stage director in his prime, unmatched really, but his two efforts into film, this and the appalling mess he made of 'A Little Night Music' revealed that he just didn't know what to do with the camera, or how to direct actors for film. Someone should turn it into a musical. I think it could work really work."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Avoid it. The top portion is made of plastic. No matter how I adjust, it will not stay leveled. You will need to get a separate ballhead to mount your camera. The mounting screw is too recessed. You will need to carry a screwdriver to mount a camera."

It is a little pricey for what it is, but it is worth it. We have purchased several others from the store and they are great quality and I think they will last a long time. This toy is fun for all ages.It was a gift for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it.Perfect for my son"

This is a top quality seat, attractive hardware, and not much more can be said about a toilet seat! Worth the money, and can throw out the junk bought previously!"
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Snapbridge is a joke bordering on fraud.  I ordered the camera and waited 8 months for delivery in order to take wildlife photos.
The remote control was vital to my work.  Spent and entire day trying to get remote control to work.  I was using an I-phone 6s and all the latest software and it wanted a wifi connection as well as bluetooth.  Either one did not work.  I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.  If i made claims in my business like Nikon made in selling me this camera I would be in jail for fraud."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"The magnets weren't strong enough to hold it up on the side of the fridge.  It kept sliding down.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,I can barely get two or three targets to set before shooting the third or forth makes them fall back down.......It is what it is....not a bad target to shoot pellets at and at least you get some movement and noise. I'm shooting at it with a .22 caliber Beeman Silver Kodiak X2 at around 800 FPS .....25 yards....and it had dented and distorted the targets pretty bad.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,CG,"This seems like a really good set, and the instructions are pretty easy to follow. I'm very pleased with the purchase. I will definitely order another one if I'm ever in the market for a similar set.

Update: I've been using these for a while now and they are a bit difficult to close and close. I had to use a magnifier to close them. I just turned them on and they were pretty accurate.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,"The Power Wheels Dune Racer (C)

""Dune Racer"" is a spin-off from the original Dune Race, which took place on a beach in the Pacific Ocean.

The Dune Racer is a 3D model of the Dune Race. The Dune Racer is painted in a translucent, dark red, and has a white propeller. The vehicle is powered by a rotary propeller, and the two engine types are a rotary engine and a rotary engine with a number of small propellers. The engine is designed to ""overheat"" and ""plow"" the sand. The Dune Racer is not only a spin-off from Dune Race, but also a spin-off from ""Dune Racer"".

Dune Racer was created by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games. This was the first of many of the Dune Race toys that Mattel released. The Dune Racer was made by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games.

The only thing that I can say about this Dune Race toy is that it is very nice and interesting. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It is really fun to watch the sand come out of the Dune Race.

I received this toy as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. It is very easy to use and very easy to learn. He also loves playing with it and he plays with it a lot. I think it is a good quality toy.Very cute.  The hair is really cute."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I wanted to measure the amount of light actually landing on a work surface vs. that at the source. I could see that there was a difference in the illumination under the 75 watt halogen flood lights in my kitchen vs. the any of the LED replacement lights I tried, but I couldn't quantify it until now. Using this meter I measured the LUX at the counter level and saw that reading under the supposedly equivalent LED was as much as 400 LUX less than the halogen. Now I have a yardstick by which to measure LED lighting performance and report in same in future reviews of LED lights I experiment with here at Amazon."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"This hat goes perfectly with the ""queen of hearts"" costume. It adds some cute flare for pictures. However, it did not work to wear the hat all night. The hat portion slides onto a headband. The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely.
The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"The cover art of headless viewers watching television says it all. My only brush with the late Neil Postman came when he spoke at the university I was attending in the northwest. A breezy east coaster, he was unaware of the need to step on eggs. During the questions, one woman said, ""Mr. Postman, how can we help children have self-esteem?"" to which he replied, ""I don't want them to have self-esteem; I want them to esteem something other than themselves.""

After the stunned silence I and a few others rose and started clapping; it was very much as if life had been returned to Pepperland in Yellow Submarine. I've been clapping inwardly ever since, as when I read this book.

There are hundreds of reviews of this book, which created a stir everywhere. Everyone (except the people running TV) seems to have read it. Most readers find it smooth going. However, those who don't want to tackle the book can still wrestle with the ideas. In Postman's essay collection, Conscientious Objections, he replies to the question ""Why are books so long?"" with the answer that they don't have to be, and as an example gives a short version of this book.

The basic thesis is that along with George Orwell's 1984 in which civilization lapses into a dystopia (opposite of a utopia) ruled by oppression and violence, there was the opposite vision in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that society would be destroyed by indulgence in pleasure. Postman says that while you can make a good case for the first view, the second is in full swing. Now if only the desperate networks would read this book and (re)turn to making good TV."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.  Henry's book was worth the wait.  I loved that the conflict facing the couple was not external to them but internal fears that the Diana most conquer before getting her happily ever after.  After reading so many books that have gentlemen spies or villains it was nice to read a book that focused on the characters and their relationship.  I loved this book and hope that more Weston books will be coming.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have been on Eugene Peterson kick recently. The more books that I read from him, the more I am drawn to his writing. He is wise, earthy, and poetic, a wonderful combination. Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination (1988) was the most recent.

In Reversed Thunder, Peterson explores the creative and imaginative language of St. John in the last book of the Bible. In my experience, many books about the Revelation of John attempt to provide a key to the events of the book as a type of apocalyptic road map. In other words, many books claim to have found the key to the end times and are eager to share their findings. This book is refreshingly different.

In the introduction, Peterson wrote, ""I do not read the Revelation to get additional information about the life of faith in Christ. I have read it all before in law and prophet, in gospel and epistle. Everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the previous 65 books of the Bible...I read the Revelation not to get more information, but to revive imagination."" Later: "" I have taken the position that this book does not primarily call for decipherment, as if it were written in code, but that it evokes wonder, releasing metaphors that resonate meanings and refract insights in the praying imagination.""

To be honest, this is the first thing I have read about the book of Revelation that I have actually benefited from, actually enjoyed. Peterson, a poet in his own write, writing about the poetry of St John is a lovely gift. If you are someone who has been confused by the book of Revelation, I would commend Reversed Thunder to you.  It is well worth the time."
Books_5,3.0,OR,I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.

 Wonderboys will especially be appreciated by anyone who is a writer. The film will leave you with a thoughtful smile."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is a movie based on a controversial trial, where everyone's opinion then and now is already made and we all KNOW she was guilty of the conspiracy...  But was she?  This production will not answer the question, but takes the viewer, with our XXI mind through the trial process, the witnesses accounts and evidence presented at the trial.  we all know the story and the facts, but watching this movie is a great way to question the process, the fundamental principles of justice and the moral dilemma that the main character had to face - in real life.  This is movie shows us that the trial was as much about the conspirator as it was a trial of the defense lawyer and makes you ponder how would you have reacted if you were a juror? how about if you were the lawyer?

Books_5,4.0,CG,"Other reviews have described the book as ""the best"" of its kind, and I'm not.

I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.

I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This was a two day project to put together.  We stopped the first night after an hour or so when we saw how slow it was going to come together.  My husband had to make holes larger in the metal parts in certain places because it wouldn't go together otherwise.  We sweated it out, and it was a pretty unpleasant experience.  Generally my hubby can make ANYTHING work, and he did with this, but lets just say you better start off as a happy couple beforehand because this thing was a b*tch.  Now that it's all done, sitting sturdily, I might add, in our entryway, we're thrilled.  We really like how it looks, the two of us can sit on it at the same time, we hang everything up there, leashes, coats, basket of bandannas on the top shelf, shoes on the bottom, sunglasses up top, you name it.  Very handy.  I think it was like 20 bucks cheaper the week after we bought it, but I wasn't too upset because it is a nice quality piece.

I read this book in the middle of the night, and I'm a bit nauseated by the fact that I'd been reading it for about two hours. I wasn't sure what the story was about, but I guess it just made me feel better about myself. It was great. I just didn't want to put it down. The story was all about the very first person, and that is exactly what I wanted. The character development, the characters, the world building. There is a lot of blood, but that doesn't detract from the story. It was a lot more focused on the main character, and the relationship between him and her. It was a good read, and a great story.

It gets points for the outside appearance and the fact that it has actual glass and not cheap plastic. The latch is okay. It does the job but could be improved in quality.  On the inside the is where it appears cheap to me and how you hve to set up the dividers.  I think they were aiming for you to be able to customize the set up but it comes off cheap to me. The dividers feel like the re little more than felt covered cardboard. Maybe I didn't read the discription fully I will have to recheck but I thought the diveiders were built in and that is why I was most disappointed.  I do like the fact that the cushions are removable because that mens you can store more than just watches in this case. It works well for almost any men's jewelry. I went ahead and gave three stars because if it wasn't for the dividers I would have been pleased with the purchase and maybe a better latch.  Needs to be better priced for what it is though. Just in my opinion.

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"I'm a fan of Klipsch, and I bought the Klipsch Define 2 for my mother. I've had the Define for a year and have not had a problem with it.

The Define 2 is a perfect replacement for my Logitech Harmony. I would definitely buy it again.Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I didn't want the cable to be bent over and on my charger. It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet. I like that it has a small detachable charger that you can leave in the charger for emergencies. I would recommend this product for those of you who are not concerned about your cable.I have a little cable bag that is used with my Kindle Fire.  It is not waterproof, but works well.  It is very durable.  I use it with my Canon 5D and it holds the Kindle Fire.  I do wish it had a wireless adapter to make it portable.  I was very disappointed in the fact that the size of the bag was only two inches.  I also have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.  I had a little problem with the tablet not being able to move in the bag.  The zipper is a bit too small for it.  It does not fit a tab.  The zipper is very secure and it does not fall off the side of the tablet.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a comfortable bag for the Kindle Fire.Great price and works great"

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Most Anime's that come out have clean, well-defined lines as well as neat sharp colors.  This is the common style not only for mass consumption but for ease of the work load by standardization.  While Casshern of course has its roots burried deep in all that makes Anime look like Anime, it's one of very few that have ventured beyond for a more artistic delivery.  At times there are some very sketchy lines, contorted facial features, rapid action that instead of a subdued unmoving backgrounds, every part of many frames are animated to keep the eyes fairly treated.  Casshern is a great story, one that in the first half is nearly perfect, if only the second half could have carried it as gracefully.  Still, the second half isn't one to scoff at, as it's still great and brings with it the finality of the characters that over the course of the show you come to enjoy, even Ringo.  What makes this show great is that it isn't teathered to its source material, and instead of being a tribute, it's a reboot.  This isn't only one of the better animated shows ever produced, but a great story as well.  One that isn't necessarily just for fans of Anime, but people that can appreciate the medium.  I highly recommend the blu ray in particular as this was a modern produced anime, so the clarity and color were practically made with the format in mind."

You could guess what was gong to happen with Mic and Jordan. Ha! J.B. fools you completely. The book takes you where you didn't expect to go. You learn more about Mic. And just when you think things are going to heat up, a different sort of excitement happens and you are left wondering now what?

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food). Let me ask you, can you tell me how much food was consumed in your household this week? I cant."

In this novel, Alexa Zimmerman has opened a bed and breakfast in her grandmothers old home.  One of her long-term boarders is a journalist who has ulterior motives for being in Arborville.  Also coming to the community is Anna-Grace, a cousin of Alexas, who is planning on marrying Steven.  Secrets, both from the past and in the present, abound among the novels characters.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is the same story as Jag but from Roxy's POV. There is a lot that you learn about Roxy and why she is the way she is. It really awesome to see things from her POV which made for a more well rounded story. She really is a strong person and I really admire her.
Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple.
I loved how raw and emotional the story line was. It felt like it could be one of those documentaries about a real life situation. I felt deeply invested with the characters and hoping for a good outcome. It's definitely not for those that like all the flowery words and a perfect story because it's far from that.

Moreover, the person in the Coleman version playing Charles Darney hardly resembled Carton, which was essential for one to believe that such an ending could occur. Further, in this version, I could actually believe that Carton had found some semblence of peace and joy in the sacrifice he had made--dying--so that the person he loved would be happy. Up to then his life was a mess--dissipation, cynicism, and recklessness. It shows how genuine love can sometimes turn a person's life completely around."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Having read and enjoyed Jonathan Moellers The Frostborn series, I was eager to dive into his latest release, Hyperspace Demons.  That eagerness was rewarded by a thoroughly enjoyable, action packed story.

As a novella, the story ramps up to speed quickly.  Moeller does a very good job introducing new elements, like hyperspace and its risks, plus the equipment aboard the spaceship, all in the middle of a steady stream of exploits and conflicts the characters must deal with.

Everything comes together in a nice package.  The action is well done and kept me furiously turning pages.  But wait, theres more.

Mixed in with hyperspace and spaceships is the interesting concept of hyperspace microbes that can possess a human mind, driving the person insane.  These microbes are kept out of the spaceship by a special shield, so there shouldnt be any problems, right?

Thats where the plot pulls off some unexpected twists and turns, making for a fun read.  Moeller keeps up the pace all the way to the end.  Amazingly, for a novella there is much more that could be said, but I fear explaining anymore will reveal too much.

Too often, shorter stories leave me feeling unsatisfied.  But not Hyperspace Demons.  Interesting story.  Well told with plenty of action and a surprise or two thrown in.  Good job Jonathan Moeller."

I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.

Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""

Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.

Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

Rating now downgraded to two stars.

My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony.

This was my major problem with the book - although I enjoyed reading it, I had to keep going back to keep track of the plot. So many confessions and explanations!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about Saba and her journey to recover her twin brother, Lugh, after he is kidnapped from their home at Silverlake.  Saba is very close with her twin brother and puts him on a pedestal...he is the light to her dark.  When the reader first encounters Lugh, he is a father-like figure, taking care of the day-to-day needs of Saba, their father, and their younger sister, Emmi.  Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.  Along the way, she also meets Jack and a gang of revolutionary girls called the Free Hawks.  We watch how she grows as a person and learns the importance of family and friends.  I highly recommend."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I. Go get one today!"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Bought as a gift for my kids for christmas. They have really enjoyed this track. They love that they can race two cars at once. It is a bit annoying that it is virtually impossible to get the track to lay completely flat. The most logical way to store it is rolled and so the end of the track is always curled up. That said, it isn't a big issue. If we want the end to be flat we hold it down with books or something similar. We have only used the suction cup attqchment. It works very well, we stick it on the window and it stays very securely. The track is flexible, so sometimes we put things under the track to create variety. It is a great track and it has received a lot of play time in the year that we have had it. All of my kids (ages 2,4,6,8) have really enjoyed it."

All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol."

A little romance in the end, but no real depth or depth to the story.  I felt like the book was going to be a bit over the top with a lot of sex.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sex.I enjoyed this book, very much.  I have read all of the books by Will Eisner, and I was quite impressed with them all.  The book is short, and doesn't have a lot of action, but it is a good read for those who love a good mystery.  It's not a story of how it all started, but it's a great read.This is a book about a teen in the 60's.  It is a perfect addition to any library of books that you read.  I bought it for my grandson and he liked it.  I'm always looking for more of this type of books.  I would recommend this book to anyone.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product)."

Also, I like that I can just wipe the dirt off."

Nice having two different thermometers to check different parts of the meat.  I use this for cooking in the oven.  I leave the timer outside and put the meat in with the thermometers and this works fine.  I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.  I'd recommend this, I've used it a couple times now without issue.  There is an on/off switch too which should help with the battery."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Every review I've read has been quasi-negative but not being one to listen to critics, I took a chance.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Depending on why you go to a movie, you may not like this because it is not escapism.  It deals with real life issues and things most of us can relate to.  I found the movie to be very refreshing and all the characters real to life.  The main character is a single mom trying to raise a precocious son.  She has to deal with a dead-end relationship and an aging father, an irresponsible sister and a job she hates.  How she copes and what she does is more believable than most of the ""chick flick"" films out today.  I think this is one of the better movies in a sea of fluff to spend time and money on.  Amy Adams is wonderful and it is always refreshing to see Alan Arkin.  Please don't dismiss this film because of iffy reviews.  It is worth going to see."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well...."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on.
Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toes is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose.
Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly.
Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it was slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect.

But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issues I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling.

I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my feet hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issues (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my soles is preicous, and when my upperfoot aches (the bones), having less constriction as this style provides helps.

The style is a bit matronly, so don't expect the height of fashion. Just nice support and comfort for troubled soles."

Some may prefer the 2L, but I love the size and weight for a setup not requiring an extended burn time for (ie. home defense).  It mounts very well with the Magpul MLOK Offset mount.  I did make one small modification that would be nice to see from the factory as an option.  I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.  I do love the variety of attachment methods that they provide standard with the light.  It is an ideal switch type that comes with it that allows for both momentary and constant on.

It's on the buggy side as sometimes my mouse gets ""lost"" and neither machine works with input and I have to unplug the cable and plug it back in. As my laptop is right on the desk it's no problem but if you have this tucked away it could be an issue.

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work. Normally either a KVM or switching inputs would solve this except my gsync monitor only has one input and a KVM limits the frame rate and breaks gsync so that's not a solution for me where this is.

I've used a few different KM switches and they are all problematic, this is the most seamless solution I've found yet."

I feel disappointed cause the first book was not so bad and she seemed a strong character. I had read what Wendy wants and it was cute.. That was the only reason why I gave this book set a chance. It's not right for a little girl to do grown up stuff and that right there was the last straw. Well lesson learned no more from this author..I'm not a prude but it's way too much!!!  If it had just told the story of her leaving and her life in hiding...The level of abuse was really something I can't get into and I really feel others will feel this way too. DISAPPOINTED IN THE EXTREME!!!!
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog just loves these. And they seem to hold up better than most dog toys do.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years. I to can not afford a brand new MacBook Pro, but getting one used is less expensive and they work and hold value. Highly recommend this MacBook Pro."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"For the price, this case just rocks.  You compare this case to a similar one at Walmart and you are going to pay 3 times as much.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Dead Wake by Erik Larson is an engaging account of the sinking of the Lusitania. Using both primary and secondary sources, Larson tells the story from all sides. Once finished, the reader better understands not only what happened on board, but inside the U-boat that sunk her, as well as the broader historical context.

This is the first book of Larson's that I've read, and it officially made me a fan. His narrative style is smooth and entertaining. He was able to tell the story of a huge event using the little moments that better help us connect to history. Another great feature of this book was getting to understand what was happening not just on board the Lusitania, but also on U-20, the U-boat that sank her. Learning about that particular tour reinforces one of the themes of this account - that a million little things happened that led to the sinking. If just one of these many things had changed, on either side, the Lusitania would simply be the name of another ship from a bygone era.

Anyone interested in history, WWI, maritime history, U-boat history, or the politics of war will enjoy this book. It is extremely well written and just as important, accessible to the average reader.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I don't like to wear pantyhose because I don't like the compression around my midsection.  However, I had a wedding to go to and it was cool enough that I didn't want bare legs.  I had a long skirt, but I wanted stockings longer than knee-highs just to be on the safe side.  So I figured I would try these.

These fit me pretty well.  I am right in that height/weight combination where I can wear either A or B sized pantyhose, and I'm a size 8 or medium in most US-sized pants and skirts.  They had a slight reinforced toe, which I appreciate, as I tend to get runs in pantyhose/stockings/etc.

These had no holes or runs in them and I did not damage them when I put them on.  This is a big plus since I tend to ruin a lot of garments of this type.  These seemed particularly sturdy to me.  They stayed up.  The silicone part is inside the lace at the top and it is clear so it will not show, even if you intend for the tops of these to show (I'm hiding mine well under my skirt, but the option is there for you if you want it).

There were a few loose threads at the top but they weren't terribly noticeable.  In the end, because these fit and seemed really sturdy, I'm quite happy with them.  You can be practical with them if you want, too, if your skirt is long enough, or you can show off the tops for a different look.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

I recommend this book to any reader looking for a great contemporary romance that will tug at your heart and make you smile."

We have 4 pair of sand and 2 pair of the black in TuffRiders. I liked the sand as it's a shade darker than the tan and looks better while still not getting too hot in the Florida sun. The cotton spandex blend is well done and my 11 year old has already handed down her jods to her younger sister and you can't tell.

Cons:
Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much

I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This game is very creative, i will give it that. The components are lacking. The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped if you don't feel like replacing the parts.
It's a good game to play with 6 people, although it does take seemingly forever to get to your turn again (i was always the last player to go, so it didn't help).
I wish i wasn't a visual learner sometimes, because when people read off their cards it's a bit hard to follow, but i just asked for the card to be passed around the group if there was nothing ""secret"" on it.
With six people playing it can take 3 hours of playtime, depending on how the game goes. We got this for our D&D group for when some players cannot show up but we still want to play something. However, with how much of a hit it was in the group, we may have to start another night for playing just this game!.
I would give it 5 stars, but the piece problems are a bit annoying."

From my research, DMG is produced naturally by both animals and humans and it's supposed to boost immune response (by over 400%!). It can also support skin health, glucose metabolism and brain function.  I am hoping that this will be helpful for her to make her aging process healthier.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The Nordan family has problems.  The death of three of them in rather gruesome ways is the least of it.  The head of the family Amos Nordan is a cave man in his thinking, about woman, and the government interfering with his business, and its causing the rest of the family nothing but trouble.  Lucky for the readers there Judge Deborah Knott, with her easy and funny look on life, and of course the need to stick her noise into places it shouldn't be, but than what kind of Judge would she be if she didn't do thank.  In the end all the string will be neatly tied, and of course the killer will get what's coming to um.

Margaret Maron really writes a great mystery.  The book is fun to read, and the killer isn't all that obvious.  Her characters truly come to life within these pages.  This is the first of her books I have read, but it will not be last.  If you are fan of southern mysteries, with real woman characters, you'll love this book.  I can also recommend this book highly to fans of Sharon McCrumb, another great southern mystery writer."

I was intrigued by the description of the book. It sounded like an interesting story about overcoming adversity...While I understand that nobody is perfect, I felt that each of the main characters should have known better.  Also, there were a lot of unneccesary parts which made the ""story"" drag on and on.  After investing more so mch time in this story, I expected something more out of the ending!

That said, I think the narrator did a great job and her reading of each character was very distinct!"

There are supposed to be little foam stickers for the corners that help keep it gripped, but it works fine without them so I just went with it.

The extra weight is in the way of the legs. This is why I ordered the full size instead of the 8"" version. I had to order a second size so I could use it when I run with the legs bent over and on. I like that the legs are longer than the 8"" version. I have a small belly and I feel that the extra weight makes it a bit heavier. I would have liked to have been able to do that. I had some other reviews and they said the extra weight made it easier to hold my arms in the arm position. I have to say the extra weight is nice. I haven't had any problems with this on my bench."

I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"It took me 2 attempts (months apart) to make it through this book.

I don't enjoy adventure stories all that much. I need my brain to be stimulated by conniving plot twists or revealing secrets or a romance. Adventure stories don't provide that for me. They move at a slower pace that just builds and builds but never seems to go anywhere. And that is the problem here.

This story is pretty much documenting Leah's journey West once she discovers the truth about her uncle. I wanted gun fights and showdowns, not the dark reality of a pilgrimage West.

That being said, the realism is one of the highlights of the novel for me. What I really enjoyed about this book was that it was very realistic. The pilgrimage to the West was a gruesome and often deadly journey for those who decided to try it. Whether it was for gold or a new life of freedom, some people and families found it to be worth the risk and I think that is all beautifully represented here. Carson has done her research about what was in store for these people and it shows throughout her writing. For world-builder fans, you will be more than satisfied with this."

I had to replace a couple of the containers because the cover was breaking off.

The containers are in good condition, they are well made and look good.

They are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full set into the container.

They are not as sturdy as I thought they would be, but they will not break if I get too much use out of them.

I would not recommend them.I ordered these to help with my baking that needed some baking powder in it.  I love the color and the color is perfect.  The only issue is that I only used one of the top caps.  I wish I had purchased the other one for my bed.  I wish the top caps had a little bit more space to hold the top of the baking.  I will probably buy a different one.  They are also great for making cookies or cookies that I don't need to bake in the oven.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the freezer.  These work great for that.This is a good quality and works well. It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. The only thing I am a little concerned about is the size of the cover. I put it on my countertop, and it's way too small for the little pillows. I think this is a good size for the room.

It's well made and it's very well made. I received this item as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. Very cute. My granddaughter loves it."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I am probably not the best person to write a review for this book. I love this series when it first came out, and now with each book I just get more and more disappointed. This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance. The sex was typical for these types of manlove books. I was just annoy cause it didn't connect or update on any of the other books in the series. Really this is not a series!!!! These should all just be stand alone books."

Fabulous for those high wall spaces in a cathedral ceiling kitchen!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"We are heading to Maui and are planning a snorkel trip to the Molokini crater, but have gotten the worst sunburns from snorkeling in the past, because the sunscreen washes off so quickly in the salt water.

Pros
- My son really liked this rash guard/sunscreen top.
- The unique white stitching gives it some style (over just plain black).
- We ordered one size up from his normal size, and it fits quite snugly, so the sizing is about
  two sizes smaller than his typical American size shirt.
- It is well sewn and dries quickly.

Cons
- If ordering again, he would probably order two sizes up from his normal size.

I would purchase this product again.

I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item.  I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I cant hold or touch the products before buying them.  So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item Im thinking about purchasing.  I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others  to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience.  Amazon's ""Verified Purchase"" indicator shows that this review matches an actual product ordered and delivered from Amazon. If you have found this review helpful, Id love if youd indicate that below.  Also, feel free to ask any other questions about the product that I haven't answered."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Outstanding classic. True story of a small group of courageous British explorers in 1912 that dared not to show weakness in face of great pain and suffering during their journey to and from the south pole. Good cinematography of a frozen wasteland. A ""horrible place"" as Scott said."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."

The light is bright enough to see your way through a night of darkness.  The light is bright enough to see when you are walking through the woods or working on a project.  I use it to light up my camping campfire when it's dark and when it's dark at night.  It's great for reading.  The only downside is that it does not have the same color as the standard color setting.

On top of this, the mask is also pretty comfortable for a respirator. The silicon part that deals to your face is very soft."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"There were slightly tight when i got them but loosened up over time to fit perfect.
These are amazing. I got them just to have something to slip on to take the dog out. Then I just started wearing them all the time. Just used them in 13 degree weather with a few inches of snow with no socks. Worked great.
They look nice and seem to hold up against the snow and salt here in the north east of the US.

I'll probably buy another pair to use when I""m out because I hate shoe laces.

They must use some kind of alien technology to keep your feet warm. There is no way humans created open, no lace shoes I can wear without socks in the snow and be warm. I'm waiting for the history channel to do a piece on these to explain it."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"In the short story, ""Desired by the Wolf"", Mac Flynn introduces us to a realistic and believable heroine that is not your typical stereotype boney thin gal you read being described in most stories. Lenore is honest to herself and to others about her not so perfect body. She is witty and challenging. The storyline captured my attention and held it to the very end. It did not take me long to get on Amazon and buy the complete box set of ""Desired by the Wolf"". The only problem with the story was that it was indeed too short.

It takes the best low-light no-flash pictures of any camera I've had -- finally beating out the old F2.0 Sony camera I had back in 2000. I've looked for years to find something like this, and can finally replace my Fuji F10 (which wasn't as good, but had clean high ISO low-light performance).

And altough I thought I'd hate it, I ended up LOVING the pop up flash -- so convenient compared to toggling computer menu options.

I'm quite impressed. You can see thousands of photos taken using this camera at DisneyFans.com in the Disneyland 2009 gallery."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ordained Irreverence is part of a series of four Elmo Jenkins books.  I have devoured all of them.  They are the greatest.  While I am not part of the inner circle of the church politic, that is to say I don't get paid for what I do in the church, I know what transpires and Moody catches the spirit of the church with such good natured delight and pleasure that you can't help but love him and overlook the obvious shortcomings of those who work within the Body of Christ.  We are human and how God ever made us the holder of His way forward in the world has got to be one of the great mysteries of the age.  Moody captures that conundrum with good nature and good will.  I highly commend all four of these Elmo Jenkins books.  They are worth your eye sight."

The sounds are loud and remind me of (if you can fathom this) a raspy-throated human infant processed through a vocoder synth. Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.

She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.

It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!)."

Many of the other types of coasters had common complaints of a dripping glass or glasses sticking to the coaster surface. Neither appealed to me.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My 21 month old, 50 pound lab mix needs something to chew on every day. He chews between 30 minutes to one hour daily. Most toys he can destroy in a day or less. This includes the giant ropes! The only chew toys that last are heavy duty Kong toys and these Nylabones. He prefers the nylabones and rarely goes for the Kong toys. I keep two or three different shape and textured nylabones out for him all the time and replace them every 9 to 12 months. That's about how long it takes him to chew it down to about two inches. This regular shaped bone and the wishbone are his favorites over the heavily textured type. I can't tell the difference by smell of the different flavors and he doesn't prefer one flavor over another either. I like these over real bones because he isn't able to chew off a sharp chunk and swallow it. These shred in small bits like sawdust and won't hurt your pet if swallowed. The Dura chews keep my pup content and away from the shoes and furniture so we are both happy campers!"

He even had fun pretending that he was looking for Big Foot. The handles are very easy to hold, and the periscope is light weight making it easy to bring on a nature walk or hike. My 3 year old even had a blast playing with it. The periscope can be used inside as well to peek behind couches and ""spy"" on siblings or parents. That makes it a great toy for sunny AND rainy days! The light makes it fun to explore at night too so this would be a great toy to bring on a camping trip! This periscope is also durable which is a must when being used by little ones!

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"""Knowing"" (2009) is directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow, I,Robot). This film is about a time capsule that is opened fifty years later with pictures drawn by children, however, one of the pictures drawn by a child was only filled with numbers. This sheet of numbers falls into the hands of a scientist who discovers that they predict various disasters. This is the second time over the past two years that I have seen this film, but this was the first time that I had seen it on blu-ray, and this really is the way to see this film. It's a beautifully directed apocalyptic sci-fi film that looks and sounds amazing (DTS HD Master Audio;5.1 Dolby Digital). There was one scene of a forest fire that was so vivid with the crackling sounds of fire that I felt I was right in the middle of a forest fire. When I first saw this film on dvd I thought that it was okay, but it was only after seeing it on the blu-ray format that I really appreciated its majestic beauty. If one has enjoyed the ""X-files"" TV series then one may enjoy this film too."

I love that it comes with two small pieces that each come with a lid. This allows you to assemble the pieces as you wish. The pieces come in two different sizes, so I don't have to worry about them getting lost. I was able to find some pieces that are small enough to fit in a plastic bag. I love that the pieces are not glued together so they don't fall out. The pieces are sturdy and look just like the picture. The price was good and it's a great set. I would definitely recommend this. My daughter loves it and was very happy with this. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a nice price for what it is.

I'm not sure how long they will last, but they are definitely worth the money.

I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I wanted to use it with my TV. Basically use a Bluetooth headphone with a TV. Once you connect to a bluetooth device you can hear this background humming sound. I'm very sure that its from this device and not the bluetooth headphones. I use the headphones very regularly. The humming sounds I suppose can be ignored because once the sound starts playing you don't hear it. But then there is a delay in the sound. I think it's about half a second (or maybe 300ms) which is pretty bad. Bad enough that you can't really watch TV like that. Considering the quality of sound, the delay and the background humming, its not worth the price.

I haven't tried other products so I don't know if this is a standard problem with all Bluetooth Tx."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very nice set!  The movies are crisp and clear and we watched it right away.  The only reason I gave it a four star instead of a five star was the second movie case top on the side was sawed through with black flaky stuff.  Don't know how that happened, but it didn't affect the DVD.  Of course, the CD was wonderful to listen to.  Love Kenny Rogers movies and songs!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My daughter loves this set.  The deal I got included both pieces, even though a number of reviews claim you only get one.

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I gave the book two stars because at least the author tried to teach the reader about wool and spinning, but that's about the only entertainment value I could find. I couldn't get into the book. I just couldn't find the rhythm or flow anywhere. The writing style is very juvenile and just odd. I couldn't finish the book but at 35% I couldn't invest anymore time.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is still the best biographical introduction to the poet Emily Dickinson but it was written in the l970s and tends to include only  material denigrating Susan Dickinson from bystanders from that era. Since Sewall's book, more information about the relationship between Emily and Susan has been uncovered and sheds new light on the subject. In addition, Sewall leaned heavily on material provided by Mabel Loomis Todd about Susan that is - shall we say - one-sided. The book is particularly strong on Emily Dickinson's forbears, family and early years and for this and more I highly recommend it. The chapters on Otis Lord and Samuel Bowles are particularly revealing."

Bright enough for most utility tasks, solid construction, sturdy pocket clip and a simple single mode operation via a tailcap switch. For me this is a perfect EDC utility light."

I'd say this is a great kit for a 4-6 year old. The details are great and the basic instruction booklet is great. The kit is a little hard to get the pieces together, but it is very easy to do. The only thing I would change is to order the kit separately. I ordered it at a discount and it arrived on time. This kit is a lot of fun. I love this little game!  My son loves to play with it. It has a lot of fun for our little ones!  We have been playing it a few times now and it has been a great addition to our play time. I highly recommend this game!My daughter loves this and she has been playing with it for a few months now. She loves it. She was going to buy more of it but this one was perfect. I was just worried about the sound quality. My daughter loves playing with this and she loves this little guy. She is always checking the website for it and it is always a good idea to check the reviews on Amazon. I would not buy this again!  It's not a toy that is easy for a child to put together.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nothing to Lose is vintage Jack Reacher.  This time he's in Colorado, heading to San Diego from Calais, Maine.  The locals there pronounce it 'callous' and that speaks to part of Jack's character, the part that arises when he's challenged unnecessarily.  The 'challenger' here is Despair, CO, a few miles from Hope, CO, a few miles from Halfway, CO.  Despair is a company town.  It's also a pivotal element of the classic western plot in which the hero stumbles upon a boondock town in which everyone, especially the law, conspires against him.  The law in this case tells Jack to depart, forthwith, and for no apparent reason.  Jack is not one to follow irrational orders, particularly from individuals with no authority over him, and he sets out to discover the secret(s) of Despair, with the help of a policewoman from Hope.

Lee Child's new novel points up his almost unique ability to take a simple plot with simple elements and turn it into a compelling, irresistibly insistent narrative.  By the time we reach the end we discover that things are far less simple than they appear.  They are also a bit too complex for plausibility's sake, but by then we are caught up in the wave and are carried to the powerful conclusion.

Another strong outing for Jack.  While perhaps not his strongest, it is stronger than whatever's in second place.  Highly recommended."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Unfortunately, this movie is not very good.  Such an epic moment in time truly deserves a good movie, and I was suckered into watching this on the grounds that I may have stumbled upon one.  Well, there was a reason why I'd never heard of this movie, that reason being: because this movie is really bad at being a movie.  It's EXTREMELY hackneyed and cliched, and doesn't make that okay by being fun to watch.  It's not bad because it's an anti-war movie or for any political reasons, it's bad because it's boring and poorly put together as a film.  Maybe someday they'll make a good movie about The Battle of the Somme, but as of 2016, that day hasn't come."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a very well written book. It is clear and honest. We have all been lead astray and our health has suffered. This book puts you back in the drivers seat and empowers you to believe you can have power back over your body. I read this book after reading Grain Brain and the two work nicely together. The book explains the genetic manipulation of wheat and the deterioration correlation with our health. It briefly talks about how food intolerances fit into it all. I would have liked more information on this and candida, but over all you finish the book knowing exactly what to do. There is a reference in the book to Taubes, Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It. I highly recommend this book for more research and to just hammer that last nail in the carb coffin."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Rotters is definitely a novel of unique content and fresh ideas, but the story felt more like a one-trick pony than a creative masterpiece. Kraus has honed his chops on lesser-length works and some of the stress of a full novel shows in his pacing and plotting: full bore for dozens of pages and ploddingly dull for dozens more. The corporeal and detailed sub-culture of grave robbers is splendidly realized, and the players are mostly intriguing if dull. Joey's experiences at school and at the hands of students and teachers alike are far too over the top to be believeable in any real sense. The villain of the story goes through so many self-mutilations, that he too, becomes just another unbelievable movie villain in the vein of Jason or Freddy instead of Anton Chigurh. At its condensed heart, Rotters just wasn't very interesting to me. It was like a sideshow exhibit where at first glance, you're wowwed, but the novelty wears off quickly and boredom sets in. At one point, Joey breaks his father's shovel handle. There is an entire monologue and a continuing story arc about how this incredible instrument had been with him for 20 years and had to be thrown away. The spade is the tool, not the handle. You wouldn't toss your favorite instrument because it needed a new shaft. You'd get a new one and keep using it. This book is the same way. The focus was far too prevalent on the handle, and much less on the part that mattered most. On a parting note, as a parent, this is definitely not for kids. Though targeted toward teens, the language is vile and content morbidly graphic. I'd never recommend this to a 14-year old."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

Five stars."

My kids all loved the ladybug teether and the bright colors as well. This has a large strong clip that stays securely attached to the stroller, car seat and diaper bag.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension."

Here is a remark made by Ben Jackson, a professor of a professor at Stanford: Religious Studies at Stanford University put it:
""Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up. Tears fall in our lives like leaves from a tree. Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible. The more you blame the boy, the more you have to fault human existence. The more you blame the tree, the more you have to fault the very idea of parenting. Should the tree's giving be contingent on the boy's gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed. ""
So whoever that rated low for this book, I urge you to re-examine the angle you are reading this book.  Take a deep breath and see how much love you have received from the Big Tree in your lives--your parents, your friends, your Creator.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I own a few other komachi knives and this one is no different! They all are sharp and slice very cleanly. I use this one as it suggests for fruits and some vegetables. It's excellent on fruits with a natural wax or tough rind like orange because of the ridging helps keep the item you're slicing on the knife. I've had an orange slip while I was trying to cut it with a smooth blade, not fun. My only qualm is that for some reason this knife's sheath is not like the rest the sheath has a little part that allows it to stand which keeps it from fitting into the drawers with the other knives because it is a bit bulky. But otherwise its a good buy!"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My cat cannot get enough of this perch!  I can barely get it assembled each day without her hopping up immediately.  It is easy to move around from room to room, secure, has very soft and cozy surfaces on each level.  My cat is 10 lbs.

Easy to assemble, and suction cups are straight forward although for the top two (visibly different than the other four) make sure the surface is clean, as well as the suction cups themselves.  If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts. The suction cup itself, and then the little knob that screws in (once you have the strap in place).  The more you screw in the knob, the more air is compressed out of the suction cup, thus securing it even more. So screw that in tight."

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight

these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable
headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better
than these cups."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I was a fan of twilight but the Host was absolutely mind blowing. The sheer eloquence of emotion almost made me feel as though I was part of the story. Absolutely wonderful. This is my second time reading it. Probably my favourite book so far. So gloriously intense and yet sentimental... makes me smile, cry, laugh, and frown every time I read. A definite must."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Native Tongue is an enjoyable book which translates well to riding a train, something I do every day, an hour each way. The story is crafted well enough to keep you interested, the characters are colorful, the underlying message is a decent one, and the book as a whole stands up well as I look back on it. Having said that, there's something in the narrative which makes you wonder about the author, if he's really a homicidal maniac waiting for you to stumble into his back yard.

That statement might sound a bit off-the-wall. I suppose I should admit to having read a magazine article about him recently. The book moves from colorful, with a hint of darkness, to a little edgy for the wrong reasons after you read more about the guy. Still, that shouldn't (and doesn't) take away from the book, which is a good way to pass the time on the train ride into the city.

The story is about man's encroachment on the various Florida lands that should be reserved for wildlife as opposed to, say, condos and parking lots. To be sure, this is an ever-growing problem which looms on society's horizon, only getting bigger by the day. In typical American fashion, the author takes this stand only *after* establishing his own residence in the state. ""Do as I say, not as a do,"" has never been more prevalent.

But the book isn't terribly serious. It's a whimsical fiction story which is easy to chew through at a good pace. Hiaasen is a good writer, and keeps the narrative moving well through the book. A bit peculiar in spots, the story nevertheless runs cohesively from start to finish, pausing occasionally to let you laugh at yet another silly kink in the story's chain.

All in all, a good book that's worth the read. Will definitely buy more of this author's work."

For example, why was Truscott always following Alex and how did he get all of hs inside information? How could Truscott and Michael Bell know that Alex went to Vermont? How could they end up at the gas station in the rental car without being seen? There were no other buildings around so someone new showing up would be seen. Why wouldn't Alex have heard the shot when Michael Bell killed Truscott. So, basically I liked the book a lot but the ending was a big let down."

The other two drawbacks are clearance under cabinets and furniture are limited due to the large nose. Secondly, I find it necessary to buy OEM bags spending more than I anticipated.

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"While I like the idea of my dogs having better breath, this stuff isn't the solution. Pro-Sense has some good products - I'm using their hip and joint supplement for my 14 year old dogs with real success. However, this water additive is a failure here.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

My other issue here is the inclusion of sorbitol in the ingredients. Why on Earth does dog mouth wash need a chemical fake sweetener?? I won't eat or drink anything with that nasty stuff in it and I don't want my dogs having it either. Between the sorbitol and all 6 dogs avoiding this, it's not something I would ever recommend."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

Bring on the next enstallment!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've had one of these for 3 years now, and would still buy it all over again.

Yeh, it's a little heavy.  But I'll trade that for all the flimsy vacuums I had previously put together.  And really the only other vacuum that's even compared to this one was my Kirby from 10 years ago, and that thing was beyond heavy.  I'm female, and can take this thing up and down my stairs regularly, and though it is a little on the heavy side, it's WELL worth it in terms of cleaning power.

It has a ton of attachments right there where you can get to them easily, along with an easy yellow knob for switching between floor mode and hose, and you can of course adjust according to carpet height.  Sometimes I wish the hose itself was a little longer, but that's what the extenders are for.  Using the various attachments I can vacuum everything from throw rugs, to couches, to lampshades, ceiling cobwebs, fan grates, and just about anything else you can think of.  Just beware that it's powerful enough in floor mode to shred certain things unintentionally.  I learned this on one of my throw rugs.  The thing just gobbles up anything loose, what can I say?

Durability?  Heh, I've run this thing into walls, steps, you name it - it takes a scuff and keeps on going.

The one thing to be aware of with this vacuum is that you will need to be diligent about checking/changing the bag.  Because it sucks so well, the bag will fill up quickly.  I've made this mistake countless times (probably why I do find it a little heavier.. lol), because I let it get really full after being so used to my previous vacuums that didn't suck as well.  I can also say I've never needed to replace anything non-filter related on this ever - not even the belt.

Another thing I really love about it is the cord - it's super long!! :)

Would absolutely buy another one in a heartbeat."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

I had some trouble with the first brush, but the seller was immediately there to try and resolve the issue.  He sent me another brush and assured me that it was a very rare manufacturing anomaly.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"In ""His (A Dark Erotic Romance Novel)"" we meet Kat and Gavriel. Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.

The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.

Overall, a recommended read."

His good-guy image is central to the suspense in this film that works hard to keep the viewer from believing that Ford is the true villain.  Obstepterous new neighbors are brought in to divert the viewer's suspicions that the most likely villain is Ford. Far too much time is spent on frontal face shots of Michelle Pfeiffer mulling over the spooky experiences she has after sending her daughter off to college.  Here again another diversion, the empty nest syndrome, is used to keep attention away from the true villain, Ford. The plot is transparent from the start, and we find in the end that Ford really is the true villain.  But everybody loves Harrison Ford, who just doesn't hack it as a villain.

It soaked through several towels and left a water stain on my beautiful hardwood floors.  I found a few online forums that had the same issue. I checked to make sure it was level, there were no holes, and it wasn't over full.  Well it filled up right to the brim, but it was leaking from the flimsy reserve add on tank. I ended up removing it but it was still leaking a little.

Not a sleep in bed with you kind of toy, the exterior fur is what makes them charming.  Trixies mouth is open so her cute little tongue is showing, which makes her extra authentic appearing.

Trixie arrives in bright purple, pink and blue packaging with a remote control, star glasses and her skateboard.  Even her handkerchief around her neck is purple based delight.  Screams GIRL TOY.  2 AAA batteries and 3 AA batteries are required to make Trixie come to life are NOT included.

She's a little dog, the size of a chihuahua, and light enough for a four year old to carry around.  Younger than that, which is not recommended, may drop and hurt their foot or if they roll onto it bump their head as she's got a hard interior.  Her fur is soft.  Her tongue, eyes, and nose are hard plastic.

Her bark comes in through the remote control which is kind of weird.

The remote is easy to use, just two buttons.  30 tricks- um not really, but after a few the child moves on anyways.  The skateboard moved easily on my marble floors and struggled a bit on carpet.

I was just stupid to consider a plastic bowl as safe for a dog, but the pet company who made it is absolutely irresponsible."

I had to get a size small and the shoulders are a bit large. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the fit and feel of this shirt. I am very happy with it and it will be a great addition to my collection.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but it's not too heavy. It's a good pistol, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It's bright and bright. I've had no problems with the battery, and the sight is great. I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB and other ride-hiking bikes.Works great for my husband.  He loves it.  He does not like it when he rides on the trails.

I am not sure if it is just because I like a bigger size, or if it is just because I like the color.  I am happy with it.

You definitely need the charcoal filters to keep odor at bay (unless you empty it every day, which I dont) but the stainless steel is tough and cleans completely with little effort.  I have banged this around, kicked the lid across the floor (accidentally) and dropped it full, onto my stone floor from counter height and the worst I got was a minor dent.  I have banged it hard on the composter, in effort to dislodge stuck-on stuff and the edge still looks perfect.  FOr all the abuse I put this thing through, I couldn't have made a better choice.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.

The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches.
Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.

Pros:
*Saves a ton of room
*Hardware included that worked well
*Easy to install

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

This is a great book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story with a great storyline. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun and sexy read.

The fabrics are all nice and thick and everything is quilted and padded and double/triple layered fabrics. I expected something thin and sort of cheap like dress up clothes, but it is nothing like that at all. It is really nice.

The chefs hat has a nice thick comfy pink band around the head and the white part is a soft, almost silky feeling type of fabric. It lays nicely and is not stiff to fit oddly or stand up awkwardly.

The little over mit and pot holder are quilted and adorable.

The apron is put together so nicely with nice thick material and perfect hems.

The utensil set is a thick hard plastic but has no rough edges to worry about scratching any surfaces. I thought they'd be more like dollar store quality acrylic utensils, but they're not. They're cute and nice quality.

This set totally exceeded my expectations and it is just adorable."

But, surely he couldn't be playing the piano so eloquently with such small fingers. Upon reading the credits - sure enough, he did sing, play the piano, write and produce this film. According to Ethan's online biography, he has made over $40 million for charity. He is one gifted guy."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I am absolutely blown away by these pearls. I am a jewelry fanatic and these pearls are such high quality it blows me away. I ordered them for my daughter, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I have gotten quite excited and have already bought a fair amount of wardrobe items. I ordered these pearls thinking they would be excellent for the baby photos however, this set is more appropriate once she is a teenager. The size of the pearls is almost as large as my adult size necklaces and the length is only an inch smaller than my adult size necklaces!  This set is a fantastic value. I must admit, when I saw the High quality and great size of these pearls along with the excellent knotting between each individual pearl, I immediately put it around my own neck and looked in the mirror. I think these make excellent casual pearls for a small framed woman!  These are a fantastic value. In my photos I have this necklace along with my own pearl necklace which was around 1k I believe but that was so many years ago, I don't remember. I think the size of these pearls is FANTASTIC, the shapes of the individuals don't have the consistency and perfect shape as my older pearls have but this is because these are cultured pearls. I think the cultured look adds to the intrigue of this piece. I got the ribbon that is baby blue and I think it's the perfect shade and complements the necklace well. Pink may be too feminine in my opinion for these pearls. I love the blue. Once my daughter is a teenager, I think I will replace the ribbon with a clasp.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Way before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s.

Having made a smash in ""The Karate Kid"" and the '60s-nostalgia TV series ""Call to Glory"", Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled Adventures in Babysitting.

Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date.

All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago.

Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too.

In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone) gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably.

Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.

This comedy flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This chandelier is simply beautiful.  At first I was wondering if the LED light bulbs would reflect nicely from the crystal.  The white light actually reflects and refracts much nicer. I hired an electrician to install this chandelier and another bigger one I bought on Amazon.  The strings with the crystals look difficult to put together but actually not.  If you are a handy man type, once you install the base flushed to the ceiling, it's just a matter of following the labels for the strings and hang them accordingly. My husband and I helped hang the strings.
Even my electrician said, ""wow it's beautiful:"". Definitely worth the money.
A word about the seller 7pm Lighting - given I could't find the electrician who had done work for us - I kept the boxes beyond 30 days before I found and scheduled an electrician.

I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight.

Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.

  Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This turned out to be a great deal, even though the bracelets are not really sized for a small wrist (I have experimented with other uses as an armband or anklet, with varying results). The larger ones are very thick but the design (on all four, actually) is visually attractive. They come individually wrapped but all packaged in one bag. The cord binding them is not stiff, so even though it only moves on one side, the loose ends hang down nicely rather than getting in the way of things."
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Little disappointed that this keyboard is pretty much completely solar dependent. Yes it has a small rechargeable watch-type battery, but I guess we don't have enough light in our office to keep it charged.

The keys are good quality, not completely thrilled with the slightly rounded bezel though (prefer the edges on the mac keyboards)."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Looks and Works Well.  I've installed two of these devices now and I like them a lot.  My favorites are the Rev-a-Shelf stainless steel models because they're stronger and clean up nicely.  Installation can be tricky but take your time and you'll get it right on the first try.

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,I am a breeder of Shihtzu and got these for my girls. I wasn't overly fond of the quality. They didn't really fit well. They were baggy in the legs and they kept slipping out of them. Plus the sizes weren't really accurate. I got one for my 7 lb girl and it swam on her and my 12 lb girl could fit in it but kept slipping off so was even kind of baggy on her. I would not buy again.
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"The start of the movie was--well--predictable.  The rest of it was poorly-conceived, at times inconceivable,  poorly-directed, and mostly unbelievable:  especially the ending, which was completely unnecessary.  I hope this was one of Caviezel' s earliest:  his subsequent portrayal of Jesus was superbly acted, directed and memorable-- plus his more recent movies and television."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"I bought this DVD for 5 bucks, and I still overpaid.  I wanted to like this movie!  It's a great premise.  It has Sam Jackson in it!  How bad can it be?  Well, the antidote to any potentially great movie is Bruce Willis.  He's no Kevin Costner now, I'll grant you that.  But he's very near the bottom in terms of acting ability.  In this flick, we're not really sure if he's mentally challenged or an adult or what. It's hard to tell since Willis seems that way in real life.  Not the sharpest tool, if you will.  His lack of acting chops ruins an otherwise great movie.  Hopefully, someone will do it again with a real lead actor who knows how to ... act."

These bags are sized just right for their purpose and they have paw prints on the bags making it easy to know which side is up and which side is down so I can tell where the opening of the bag is to insert the waste product. I also love the fact that the bags tear off easily from the roll. I am a senior person and some of the bags I have purchased in the past were really hard to tear from their rolls. The only problem I have with this product is with the dispenser  that the company supplies with the bags. I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but I can't pull the bags out of the dispenser correctly; thereby I don't find myself using this little green holder. This being said, I would recommend these bags to my friends as the bags themselves are really good and environment friendly."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Loved it!  I enjoyed all the references to the hokey celebrity xmas specials of my youth.  And the nod to Pee Wee Herman's xmas special - a classic.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest xmas duet of all time --- David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy.  YouTube it.  It was surreal then, it's surreal now.  Hats off to the songwriters.  Very, very clever all the way around.  And Jon Stewart!!  What a gem!  (""And now, for the Hannukah portion of the show . . ."" to quote Mrs. Rene from Pee Wee's show.)  And did I catch a Kirk/Spock moment there through the cabin door?  I got goosebumps.
Can't recommend it highly enough.  If you have a bent sense of humor and love pop culture this show will push your buttons.

It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters. The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them. This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget. This is a great book."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Wow. This for me is just vastly better than War and Peace. Instead of trying to sketch the entire Russian world, here he focuses in on 2-3 interrelated families. The psychological depth Tolstoy creates for Anna, Vronsky, Levin and all the rest of these people is just incredibly vivid. You feel their insecurities and longings like they're your own. The dialogue, both internal and external, is fantastic, and each character feels so real, so totally brimming over with this little moments of honesty and pathos. And the whole thing is grounded in small sensory details which make this whole world come vividly alive on almost every page, whether its a description of a nightgown flapping in the breeze, or the sensations of a hunter walking through the woods before dawn. There's no end of life in this book. Sorry to gush so much, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best crafted, most perfectly balanced 'big' 19th century books I've ever read. I'd recommend this to anyone"

Two side notes:

1) Make sure you look around for a water bottle that is closer to the length of the ""wick"". A normal .9fl oz (500ml) bottle is too tall for the wick to reach the bottom or at least closer to it so you have to fill the bottle up before it gets to  3/4 of the way empty.

2) If you don't use it everyday or even occasionally just from going home from work and coming back, the silver piece (metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency) at the top of the humidifier gets ""stuck"" and I have to kind of poke at it to get it running or shake the bottle up.

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"Great theory, but poor construction.  It broke on day two after around 10 total minutes of use.  Two faults:  Poor gluing of the magnets under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pins up.  I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnets from rising fully to the top.  I reglued it and another one that was loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of its socket), and then added 2 drops of super glue to the sides of the others as well.  Problem #1 solved.  Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dots on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it.  The bumps obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim.  The veneer must be very thin.  There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnets from pushing the wood up.  OR, a ""stop"" installed in the plastic mechanism to prevent the magnet plate from rising any higher then the floor bottom, as without one the spring pressure bangs the magnets up slightly into the wood.  Still working on this problem.  Very disappointed."

I was going to try to compensate for angle but didn't - too much work. Instructions are weak... not terrible, but I had trouble understanding a few things and kept re-reading - was not as clear as could be on how to thread the nylon string through the pulleys... I also wish it had adjustable mounts to accomodate angled ceilings better. It would be nice, too, if bracket mounts were made to screw into 2x4 ceiling joists.

If you have a solid ceiling, especially a flat ceiling, these will be easy to install, if you have a high open ceiling, especially with steep angle, it will require more work and improvising... but once installed, keeps my bike up out of the way."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,This product is all plastic with a fake leather like material pretty much glued on to the casing. My wife's ipad mini 2 retina would not fit this case. One side corner would snap in and the other wouldn't even push in. Past reviews say they fixed issues with the hinge. I do not agree. This product wasn't even worth the $30 I spent including shipping and the overall price is $99... It's plastic. Cheap plastic. Only reason I give a 3 star rating is because the seller responded quickly and because their shipping was so quick. My seller review would be considered a 5 star.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...
Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.
While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.
By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

So it's OK if you have a loose fit with it. It will shrink over time. Very happy all around with this purchase."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund."

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one.

Tavis, whom I admire, lets his guests speak what is in their hearts with little interruption yet through skillful guidance.  All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.
I'm eargerly awating to watch season two on DVD now, and find out what happens to Buffy and her gang!"

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"This is a good watch, but to really use it, you need to connect it to both your smartphone (via the Garmin Connect application) and a heart rate monitor (which it is often sold with as a package).

The Garmin Connect app is buggy and has been since CNET wrote it's review in 2015.  You'd think they fix it, but they haven't.  I've had to uninstall and reinstall the application on my phone twice this week and power off and power on the the phone once this week because the ""transfer failed"" message appears on the Garmin Vivoactive at the conclusion of the transfer.  In addition, there was another time where my steps would update on the application, but when I closed the application and reopened it they were lost repeatedly.

I had never seen this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was a little worried that they would find out the truth behind it, but I was a little disappointed.  I don't know why the people who did this didn't get this movie, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be so funny.  I guess it was supposed to be funny, but I guess it was more like ""One More Time"" and that would have made it more interesting.  I guess it was just a little too far fetched, but it was worth watching.  I think it was really good.  I think that people who are not interested in the movie should watch the movie and not buy it.  The movie is pretty good, but I would have thought that this movie would have been better if it was a little more complicated."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath."

The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is my first Chantal Fernando book and so I couldn't wait to jump in!!

Although I've not read the books before this one in the series, I think the author did a great job, I wasn't totally lost, but I definitely need to read the others.

Tina and Irish were great together. They were an unlikely couple but made it work. Tina had fled her abusive ex and landed in the arms of a sexy biker. Irish was everything her ex wasn't. Oh my gosh, the man is so loveable and sexy!!  He quickly is in her life and tries to get her to lower that wall that she's built up around her heart. Can she lower that wall or will she keep her heart guarded?

Because this is a novella, I feel like there's a lot more to Irish and Tina's story and it's a shame this story ended just as I was getting into it!  Overall, a great book!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Joyce's ""Dubliners"" is a collection of fifteen short stories that present snapshots of the lives of common people in  Dublin around the beginning of the 20th Century.  The stories are subtle commentaries about  Irish attitudes towards nationalism, religion, morality, life, and death.  Each explores a distinctive, dramatic theme, such as sexual perversion  (""An Encounter""), infatuation (""Araby""), the  frustration of personal unfulfillment (""A Little Cloud"" and  ""Counterparts""), self-imposed loneliness (""A Painful  Case""), hubris (""A Mother""), and Catholic/Protestant  conflict (""Grace"").  Overtones of Irish nationalism, remembrance,  and piety permeate all the stories.
The stories are neither  depressing nor uplifting, but rather  open-ended in their denouement; no  conflicts are resolved and no moral conclusions are reached.  Joyce depicts  the characters and scenes so sympathetically that the reader understands  clearly why the dejected boy in ""Araby"" leaves the bazaar feeling  like  ""a creature driven and derided by vanity"" and the events  that drive Farrington to beat his young son at the end of  ""Counterparts.""  And why, in ""The Dead,"" Gabriel, after  giving a dinner speech in which he makes respectful reference to the dead,  feels his dignity knocked down a notch when his wife reveals to him the  tragic fate of her past love.
After nearly a century,  ""Dubliners"" remains one of the best  crystallizations of humanity  bestowed upon the world."

'2012' has whacky characters, I love Yellowstone blowing up and the DJ broadcasting it live, a strong compassionate black president, oddly constructive so you're kept guessing as to what the govs are up to, some realism about 'who' would get picked to survive, and lots of visual images of crumbling various national landmarks. A fun movie for the disaster film fanatic."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Edit: Next day, friends over for barbeque. Knives were the center of attention. These colorful tools made fast work of steaks, by cut right through whole filet, and prepared assorted melons in record time. Ordered second set over dinner!

After using my pocket knife to cut a canteloupe, I decided it was time to replace a couple of ancient Henkels knives. I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off. To my relief, the cutting edge is exposed stainless steel that will sharpen nicely. Promptly tried the unusually serrated utility knife to cut a melon; I had never seen a blade quite like the wavey edge on the utility and bread knives - fantastic! Ordering extras to take as hostess gifts."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I used to have one that i bought at the big orange boxed store down the street. It worked ok, sometimes too well. It would pull interference seemingly whenever it felt like it. Ripped it out and installed this one, in the master bedroom.

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it."

Sadly, the quality wasn't very good. Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."

I have a Roku player and the TRS-80A is just about perfect. I'm sure it will last a long time. The cord is long enough for me to get on the couch and use it while playing games. I can also use the remote to turn the TV on and off with my Roku. It's not the best for long distance but I'm sure it will last a long time. I would highly recommend this product. My wife loves this mouse. She loves that it is small. She has her own usb mouse and it's so small that she can move it around without touching the mouse. It's easy to set up and she loves it.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This doll house is extremely sturdy! All of the walls are nearly 1/4"" thick wood (or pseudo-wood composite) product. Some other reviews stated that the assembly instructions were very vague and difficult to read and that the product was difficult to assemble. I am happy to report that it's not! :) The assembly instructions were extremely simple, clear, and well-written (and I'm by no means a mechanic or carpenter - I normally have major issues figuring out how to get battery compartments open on toys - don't judge...some of those compartments are a real bear! (; ). All of the parts are well-labeled and easily identifiable so there's zero confusion. All of the parts lined up perfectly (a few other reviews said they didn't, so I'm thinking the ones that didn't weren't assembled correctly).
The furniture that came with the dollhouse is also very sturdy and well-crafted. The lamp (which lights up) has a timer on it which helps with battery life. The house itself stands nearly four feet tall - it's really big! Compared to the flimsy plastic and cardboard Barbie doll houses for close to the same price (been there, done that, lasted a month before it was destroyed by light play!), this dollhouse is a hundred times sturdier and just plain superior. All in all, this is an heirloom quality product. I can easily see this beautiful, sturdy dollhouse lasting for a few generations at least!"

I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love reading about the lives of the young women who were on the train with a group of boys.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I only rated this iPad case 4 stars because I did not have anything similar to compare it against. However, I will say that I can find no fault in its design or its ability to do the intended job. I can't imagine there is another unit that could perform significantly better. It appears to be well made, rugged, attractively designed, and easy to use. I recently changed from a cover which had a keyboard built into it. That unit worked fine, but I found myself more often than not, using the onscreen keyboard. This is a much simpler cover that looks and performs nicely. I like the ability that this cover gives you to adjust the angle of the screen."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.

""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.

Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.

""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"At first I was shaky about whether or not I would continue reading this. It was long and full of emotion. As I kept turning pages I found myself more and more in love. V.L. Brock doesn't disappoint! If you ever feel like a story lacks description and detail then you need to read Impulses.

Samantha and Hayden are both shattered souls that wind up together. Their journey to get there is long, sad, and wonderful. Sam is beginning what she thinks is another temp but when she meets her boss, she cannot ignore the feelings that stir.

Hayden feels it too but his past haunts him and he's not sure if he can relive that. One steamy time together and they are hooked to each other. Forever bound.

While the journey isn't easy it's worth the wait. Impulses shows you what can happen when you just dive in and see where the road takes you. I am very impressed and will definitely add more of Brock to my collection."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"I have always wanted one of these, and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two I had were the Schlage and the Porter Cable, so it is a nice quality product.  It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

Update:  I have been working on my own electronics and this unit has finally arrived.  I have a lot of wiring and it is very easy to hook up and program.  It is really easy to program and program and it is also very easy to program.  I am very happy with this unit.  The quality is good and the price is good.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book was enjoyable and an entertaining read.  It was nice in that the book engaged me and took my mind off of anything other than the book while I was reading it.  I chose this book after seeing the cover for the latest Maisie Dobbs story and liking the picture wanting to know more.  I decided to start with the first book in the series after reading reviews by other readers and a few professionals.

I enjoyed the transition from the curreny mystery back into Maisie's background to help develop her character which added some mystery itself.  The shift back to the mystery at the end tied everthing together nicely.

I am encouraging my wife to read the book and share it with her book club.  I will likely read more of the Maisie Dobbs series."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Once again the dumb people on Amazon reviewing products amazes me. Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous.

Once i got used to the motions of it it was second nature to click on whatever I needed. Really useful for me.  If I was in an office setting where I had to give frequent presentations this would be great.  Really nice product. I was really impressed with how well it worked. The only wish I had with this product was to have a little more documentation.  The only help info is on the box and that doesn't cover much.

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"I have 2007 honda element, and it is an inch longer than my original one, which was just a couple inches long. The plastic parts are also very light and easy to remove, and the plastic part is still very durable. I am very pleased with the quality of the case. The only thing I would change is to the color of the caps. I am very happy with this case. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a case that protects the camera, and does not provide extra storage space for other items. I bought this for my wife to use with her iPad mini and it works perfectly. She loves it!  She doesn't have a lot of space to store anything other than the iPad, but I don't need to worry about that. She uses it for a lot of things, including drawing, pictures, etc. She loves it!Works perfectly, no problems with the software or even my keyboard. I like the fact that I can now see how the scroll wheel works. The only thing I wish was for the audio to be more consistent with my iPod Touch, but it is a little better than my own. I can hear the keyboard better, but not the audio. Overall, it is a great little keyboard. I use it with my iPod, my iPhone, and my laptop. I like that it is small, but not too big. It fits my iPad perfectly, and I like that it has a little bit of a clickwheel. It is a little heavy, but I have not had any issues with it.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"While I still enjoyed aspects of this series, I found this book unnecessarily complex in its mythological meanderings. I am not exactly sure was Atticus did with Granuaile for 12 years, but that might have been more interesting than this book. Things progress on the Granuaile arena, at least.

I think the conversations with Oberon seemed to get a bit too much (too cute by half) and got in the way of the story. As other reviewers have noted, I have been bothered by the brevity of these books and it sure does seem that Hearnes is using mythological twaddle as filler for his recent books. I enjoyed the first few much more, perhaps because they were anchored more in the real world. In the last couple of books there is a magical deus ex machina to solve all the problems of the complicated mess Atticus seems to have made for himself. Not sure if I will continue to buy into this series."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"First of all, it's NOT HORROR (JUST HORRIBLE)

Three completely bland, removed, uninspiring, predictable shorts that are too long and really give no real insite into the state of the ""American Family"". There's nothing thought provoking here, these shorts make an attempt to shock it's audience with violence that ends up doing nothing to add to or help drive any real message home. That's the peoblem with all three films from the very beginning you know what the message is (none being at all enlightening) and then are forced to watch a long drawn out story with no twists, no insight, and does absolutely nothing to relate to the viewer or to draw you in, 2 of which are ended with a scene of violence that utimately means nothing. The scenes are meant to shock but end up being just another scene that just happens to have blood in it. Theres no emotion, no character developement, it's bland and dull- uneffective.

Bottom line- 1.if you want something thought provoking this is not it. 2.if you're looking for gore and blood look somewhere else this just won't satisfy 3.if you're looking to be dissapointed look no further, this ones for you 4.

I've had a chance to pack out with it twice and it's way smaller than having to bring a tarp. It easily fits in the Grand Mesa's bag along with the tent, does a great job protecting the bottom of the tent from wear and the two nights we had substantial rain even though I was camped on a slope my tent stayed very dry.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

Once built they had to make the usual adjustments needed for many of these coaster builds (they had to do this at school as well) but once those were made they had great fun running the coaster around the track.

The straps are adjustable and the comes up to the armpits so you don't have to worry about you bra showing and if you have a little extra chunk where your chest and armpit meet, this covers it nicely. this is very flowy and has a beautiful irregular hemline. The drape effect comes from extra material on the sides so if you spread it out it looks like batwings. The material is soft and stretchy, but you won't need any extra stretch. It is tapered just right to show off your curves and flatters any shape.  The shortest parts comes just above my knees and longest just below. I would recommend a lint roller. I will be purchasing more in other colors. Perfect for a hot day when you want to be cool, stylish, and comfortable and all for the right price!

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.
The plot really had a lot of potential, the story would have been better had it focused on the plot and kept the romance clean and simple. Less is usually more."

She receives this e-mail one day and it's from her granddad, which is strange because he isn't alive. She can't really do much about it now. Her parents are dead and Grammy is to. So what can she do but head into Grammy's room to figure out some answers. She enters the room to find a suitcase full of pictures of everyone. She soon falls asleep and wakes up to Marshal the landlord waking her up with coffee waiting. They chat for a while and comment on how the place looks like nerdville with all the tech stuff around the house and Jen's video game collection.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This review is for the Ekouaer Womens Satin Robe Wedding Party Wear (Red, XL).

This nightgown is elegant, classic and feminine. I got the red color, the red was a little brighter than I expected but really very lovely. I also purchased the XL size. I am a size 12/14 and it does fit but its a little small. If you are a larger then a size 14 this will NOT completely tie closed. It does tie closed on me, but its open in at the bottom and doesnt completely wrap like its supposed to.

The fabric is a beautiful, soft red satin. This does need ironing so if you are traveling with it, pack a travel steamer. I think its because the fabric is so delicate. Despite the fabric being so satiny, this is NOT see through, so if you are wearing your bra and panties underneath you cant see them when its completely closed.

The lace detail is amazing, the neckline has THICK bandings of lace sewn down the front, the sleeves have lace trim and it goes up into the sleeve to give it some design flare. The lace is white or slightly off white, but it is VERY QUALITY lace and not unraveling, falling off or threatening to tear at any part. In fact, the craftsmanship and detail of this robe on a whole is VERY well made, this is something you would pay a lot of money for at the higher end retail stores. If you like delicate lingerie that is classy and makes you look good, try this robe out and you will enjoy it! 5/5 stars

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this book on a recommendation and though I gave up a few days of my life over it (and the next 2 in the series), I'm glad I did! The first two chapters were a bit slow-going, and I actually came back to the book about a month after I initially started it. However, once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The author constructs a wonderful world to set her story in and develops strong, interesting characters over the three books. In the first book, A Great and Terrible Beauty, she outlines her initial plot about a girl raised in colonial India but forced to move to a boarding school in late 19th century England after her mother is murdered. The intrigue, romance, fantastical elements, and believable scenery of England during that era make it an engaging tale. It is a great story, but also very well written. By the end of the book, I was carrying my Kindle everywhere and already anticipating buying the next installment in the series!"

She still vomited occasionally, but not more than a couple of times a month.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,I decided to tile my house and used a tile saw that has seen a fair amount of usage and it was time for a new blade as the old one was chipping the glazed porcelain tile really bad. I noticed this blade was much larger than the old one but I can only assume that is due to the amount of wear on the old one. This worked well for about 40 cuts then started chipping the tiles also. I ended out buying a much better blade and it hasn't chipped a single one yet. I guess I should know you get what you pay for.
Books_5,1.0,CG,"To compare this book to some of the other books in the series, this is the first one to be read.  The second one is also very different.  It is very much like the first one.  It is a story of one man's journey to a faraway land with no hope.  And it is told in a very different way than the first one.  It is very much a journey of discovery.  The two men are all unique, very different people.  They are all young men, they are all vulnerable, they all have a place in the world and a place to be.  And they all have a way of relating to each other and their people.  They all have a place to live and a place to be.

This is a very touching story about life, love, friendship, sacrifice and struggle.  And it is written in a very well written style.  It is a very beautiful story, a story that is not only true, but also poignant.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series."

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"The fit is alright but the clips are not keeping the earbuds well inside the ear.

I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.

Why? Because it's credible. A few years from now, something like this WILL be happening, as AI influences people, AI becomes as real as real people, and it has the chance to become all powerful.

Forget movies like Transcendence. This is the way it'll happen, pretty much."

Books_5,5.0,OR,Fabulous series of books. Finished them all as quickly as I could. This story grabs & holds on for dear life. Only suggestion would have been to condense the series from 8 books to 5. It did go off on tangents and become wordy but I loved it. It is a love story to make you laugh and cry with the characters and Jamie & Claire feel like family quickly into it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,This umbrella was very difficult to open and then just as difficult to fold back down. It feels as if after a few openings and closings it will break because of having to forse it to open.  I will not close down to the original size therefore it is a strain to wrap the band around it when it is in the folded closed position.  It will not fit back into its case. Construction not much better than a $3.00 umbrella you can buy on any corner on a rainy day.  It is pretty but not worth it.
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book was a choice of my book club. Once you get into it, you are hooked. It is like reading a historical novel, only it is true and real and quite saddening. The people of North Korea live a life of starvation, physically and intellectually. If you are interested in what happened after the Korean War to the people unlucky enough to be stuck in N Korea (as did one South Korean prisoner of war), here's your answer. The contrast with the way of life in industrial S Korea is frightening."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"As you will see in the attached image, I have thick thighs and a slightly big butt for my size but I usually wear a medium in compression pants, the smalls fit but are difficult to get into, but the mediums are usually perfect. This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good. I included the shot for reference, as I find it helps me when buying clothes online to see real women wearing the clothes, and I can almost never find someone with my shape, so I hope it helps women with a similar body type. I received these pants at a discount in exchange for an honest review, however that did not affect my opinion of the product."

I would not buy them again.  The Catit Jumbo is a better value for the price.My dog is a chewer.  He loves it, but I have a problem with it being too long for him to chew it up.  I bought another size for a different dog and he's a 5 pounder.  This size fits him perfect and I like it.  I wish it had been a little longer for him but he doesn't like it.  It was too big for him to chew on it and it was too big for him to chew on the handle.  I would have given it 5 stars but it didn't fit him well.  I will have to keep him from chewing on it because he is very picky and doesn't like having it on all the time.I have a Border Collie who is a mix.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"During the seventies, german director Werner Herzog has given us three movies - AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD, KASPAR HAUSER and HEART OF GLASS - which stay as unique pearls in Movie History. This director is a visionary,  one of the rare authors who have been able to create a cinematic world out  of their dreams. Just watch and listen to the featurette (Thank you, Anchor  Bay): this guy is an authentic genius coming from the same family of the  Saints of the Middle Ages or the most famous composers.
NOSFERATU, shot  in 1978, tries to establish a link between the german directors of the  1918-1926 period, Fritz Lang or Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau for instance,  authors who reigned over international cinema at that time and the new  generation of german directors that appeared in the late sixties with such  remarkable individuals as Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders or Werner  Herzog.
Werner Herzog is also the last of the XIXth german romantics with  his images haunted by nostalgy, with his heroes able to see what is  invisible to common people. You have to enter into NOSFERATU as if you're  about to dream. If not, you'll surely be bored after 5 minutes. But if you  find in yourself the courage to follow Werner Herzog, you will experiment  something you'll never forget.
Other Werner Herzog's movies will be  released in the DVD standard very soon, so be prepared to dream.
A DVD  dedicated to a lost genius."

But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam.
Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.

With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it.
I've had it for about 3 weeks now.
My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.
I was worried that I might be turning diabetic.
A checkup confirmed that I wasn't.
The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.

It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's.
Anyone younger should should have an easier time getting used to it.

Using a piece of good firm memory foam on the knee board should make this an excellent kneeling chair."

This also keeps the Gooby from sliding back next to their penis. This prevents the Male IG from peeing on their Gooby.  I use their Girth (chest) measurement to purchase the correct size.

The panel was tricky to align with right angles and keep at the right height. It might be easier with two people. Otherwise, it's very easy for one person to put together in very little time.

It's a sturdy piece. It works really well for me as a printer stand and the shelves are perfect for printer paper and other supplies. It is significantly cheaper than other printer stands and would also be great for its intended use as a nightstand.

The chocolate color would go well with darker stained wood furniture or black furniture (I have both in the room)."

Some have complained about the paint, and I agree it could be better, but mine has no deal-breaking flaws. There's a picture floating around these reviews of a Ripley with a big dot of paint inside her right hand. Mine has one too, but I think it's actually supposed to suggest the back of her rifle's grip, rather than being a paint error."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Loved, loved, loved this book!  Jennifer Mancini is definitely on my author to read more of list!
We start out with a substitute teacher waiting with a student during an oncoming snowstorm for her ride. Enter Dante James, hot, mysterious stranger to pick up the student Seraphina.  He's not on the approved list but Seraphina knows him well.  While waiting for approval, he has his sights set on hot, older teacher, Olivia.  She has such a visceral reaction to him and she doesn't know why, seeing as he appears much younger than she.  He notices her reluctance but feels drawn to her.  I won't give away any more of the story but it takes a turn you are so not expecting.  Truly enjoyed this short read so much that it felt like a full book!
Definitely worth the time invested!
Jennifer Mancini rocks!"
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I was interested in this book because of the uncommon setting of St. Louis--a city I love, but one that is definitely falling apart. That decay is beautifully described by Franzen. There's no doubt that the prose in 'The Twenty-Seventh City' nearly always sparkles and only occasionally falls flat, usually when he gets too caught up in his philosophical meanderings inside the head of Martin Probst (who is quietly and slowly lovable). There are so many artful descriptions and astute retellings of every-day occurrences to propel readers. Unfortunately, the interesting premise never expands much beyond its setup in the first 50 pages. S. Jammu and her comrades are interesting, but haughty, and their reasons for taking on their twisted plot are never clarified beyond vague sketches of their activist and corrupted pasts. EVERYone in high society, apparently, enters into either physical or intellectual affairs, which often defy their characterisations, and there are so many characters that are highlighted in their dull everyday routines just to service their importance in the book's ending that it drags down the beginning in middle. And when the climax of a 500-page novel hinges on the outcome of a referendum vote... well, I think that's all that needs to be said about that.
Still, Franzen's observations on our every day lives and interactions are shocking in their familiarity, and he undeniably has a good grip on many facets of how our society and culture functions. Twenty years after the fact his comments are still relevant. 'The Twenty-Seventh City' is worth reading, but only if read quickly; labouring over it and its blunted intricacies is not worth the time."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings."

The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn.

I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers.
I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book!
Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!!

Books_5,3.0,OR,"""Ape House"" is a light read that attempts to open the animal world to us by bringing the Bonobos Apes to life in an original way.

This is a story about a family of Bonobos, their caretaker scientist Isabel Duncan and a down to earth reporter John Thigpen. I will cover the plotting in a few words, it begins with the primate language laboratory being bombed and Isabel left badly injured, severe enough to end up in the trauma ward of the closest hospital. The Bonobos fall into the hands of a porn producer and are locked up in a house with cameras broadcasting their every move on cable television. Reporter John Thigpen covers the story while his personal life is on a down turn, his home life it is about to take a drastic change. The plotting gets meatier when Isabel is released from hospital and teams up with John to find out who targeted the laboratory, for what reason and what has happened to her family of apes.

The story explores in a far-fetched semi captivating manner, the issue of animal rights from the point of view of activists, scientists and the public. The plot takes a meandering course with a bit of action here and there mostly done by the humans, there are also subtle references to sexual activities amongst the apes and their unique methods of communication. I found this part satire and part morality driven tale was presented to us by a cast of lackluster and easily forgotten characters, maybe if the Bonobos had been given a greater role it would have left a more lasting impression. Unfortunately the book started strong just to peter out by the end, I was disappointed when the tale did not capture the apes' behaviour, gestures and emotions in a more detailed fashion.

Although the story was not what I had anticipated, I nevertheless enjoyed the change."

A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them...

The bright colors and fun jungle animal theme are attractive to my 6-year olds eye. The 6-piece set includes all plastic and rubber pieces, which makes this incredibly kid-friendly. Not to mention the easy-to-use test tubes include easy-to-poor tops that make it effortless to combine liquids.
Also included is activity cards. The most appealing part of the set is that all activities use household and basic craft items. This leaves hours of keeping my 6-year-old occupied and interested in learning! He is thrilled to have his own lab set that we can use over and over."

I was intrigued by the characters and their stories.  I really liked how honest Kyra was about the problems former addicts face.

The dynamic between Ellie, Drew, and Jason was very interesting.  I felt bad for her being caught between two of the most important men in her life.  I found Jason and Drew's interactions to be fascinating .  There is a lot of history there and it made for some tense moments as well as emotional ones.  However, only part of it was shared and I'm hoping we'll get more if/when we get Jason's story.

I'm really looking forward to seeing this series develop and getting to know more about the band members and their stories. Kyra has written an emotional story that shows she's done a lot of research.  It's one I thoroughly enjoyed reading."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this LED CRLight 4W Dimmable LED Filament Candle Light Bulb,2700K Warm White 400LM, E12 Candelabra Base Lamp C35 Bullet Top, Clear Glass Cover, 40W Incandescent Replacement light!  This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills!

The only reason I didn't buy it is because I got a lot of compliments on it. I really love it and it fits great!  I'm a 36 and ordered a medium. It fits perfectly and looks great. I am very pleased with this purchase. Very comfortable and my son loved it!Bought this for my husband and he was very pleased with it. He is a 36 and wears a size 8.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,CG,"Two weeks ago I adopted a kitten and she was a puppy. She was a small baby and we had two small dogs. I thought she would get the treat, but it was too small. She had no interest in chewing on it. I placed it on the floor and she chewed on it. I ended up going to the vet and got the dog food and she has not been able to chew on it. She seems to like it too. She will play fetch with it and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a puppy. Pros:
-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs. He was very picky about his food so I would give this a try. It's not a big deal and he would eat it. It's kind of hard to find in a store."
Books_5,5.0,CG,This is a really great book. The characters are well developed and the plot is well written.
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)

Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get:
(1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom."

I'm uncertain if it was caused by the demand from FSX but I do know something was notably wrong. To be fair, I may just have received a faulty piece of hardware. Nonetheless, after the third nose-dive; out it came. I didn't care about warranties at that point and I am thankful that my OS was not on it. Sadly, it was the worst hard drive that I ever had. I replaced it with a 250 GB SSD which has been magnificent. My current opinion is that Solid State is the only way to go."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I really like this product.  My 9lb pomeranians fit compactly within.  It looks a bit snug for them to sit up but it's workable.  The product is very versatile and we've already used them a few times.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

I am pleased with this purchase."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol."

I definitely think this novella adds to the Quarter Mile Hearts series. It begins before Quarter Mile Hearts and catches up with the story told within Quarter Mile Hearts. I totally loved that. I would recommend reading Supercharged before Quarter Mile Hearts.

Supercharged made me love Max even more and it even made me want to reread Quarter Mile Hearts because I missed this world so much. There were times I was extremely frustrated with Max because he kept trying to fit in instead of just marching to the beat of his own drum.

We solved that by closing/folding them closed first and pressing hard with a metal serving spoon and creasing and reinforcing that folded hinge area, and then placing them in the donuts. It worked great!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""Into the Wilderness"" is great escapist reading. Though the beginning could be described as somewhat sedate, that is certainly not the word for the latter part of the novel. I found myself tightly gripping the book during more than one exciting scene, wide-eyed and breathless as the action unfolded. Great characters people the book,  the writing is terrific, the (...) scenes are tastefully done, and the adventure is a grand one. I love this book and look forward to reading the subsequent novels in the series. Highly recommended escapist fare."

I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I love period dramas, and I thought the the premise of the series, the start of the New South Wales penal colony towards the end of the eighteenth century would certainly be of interest. Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season. Not even the excellent acting could validate the almost ridiculous plotlines. Still, I derived some enjoyment from this series, if only because cause I have a soft spot for period dramas."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Overall, I enjoyed the story. Some of the details/actions were not consistent with the time period. Also, while I think flawed characters make for much better stories, there are better ways to write in the ""flaws"" than having an antagonist point them out at every opportunity. Also, the attempt at romantic tension between the heorine and the male character grated on my nerves. The male character was presented, first to last, as an insufferrable jerk, though the implication was that he's really just misunderstood. He's being an ass to push her away because he really wants to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx....  SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future books by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery readers turning pages. Just, please, drop the annoying romance sterotypes, there are better ways to develop intimacy, meaningful and realistic connections, between characters. (A little more research on the crime element of the time period might help too)."

If you have a larger budget and want to save a lot of money and get the best possible performance out of it, this is a great choice.

I would recommend it if you are looking for a full sized HTPC.Works great. I installed it in my car and it works great. I also use it to connect my ipod to my ipod on my stereo. It's very easy to use and works great. I'm not sure if I'll be able to use it with my stereo or my ipod if I'm using it with my ipod on my car. It's a little difficult to pair this with my ipod. I can't think of a reason not to pair it with my ipod. I have a Panasonic T3i and I use my ipod with this on my car. I'm really happy with the fit of this. It's very comfortable and the sound is very clear. The only complaint I have is that the cord is a little loose. I've had it for a month and it's still holding up well.This is the only one that does not have a charging cord. It's a nice feature, but it's not the best one out there.  I bought another one and this one does not have one.

It comes with a charger and is a bit smaller than the one that came with the other one.  I'd recommend this one over the one that comes with the other one, because I have a lot of adapters and a lot of them.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I picked these up on a half price sale a few weeks back.  While I generally don't like to purchase shoes online since each manufacturer tends to fit differently.  Since I have owned Rockport shoes before I gave it a shot.  The shoes are nice looking, comfortable and a good value.
I have been happy with the past Rockports that I have owned and expect no less from these.  The sole is a ridged design so it holds the ground and doesn't slip when walking as has happened with other rubber soled shoes I have owned.
Comfort is the word that is synonymous with the Rockport brand and these shoes are no exception.  They are nice to slip into and nicer to walk in.  The rubber sole has enough give to absorb some of the shock of walking but not enough to feel cheap or soft.
I have a wide foot and normally wear a 10.5.  I fit into an 11 in the Rockports so I suggest going up a half size.
Overall, I would highly recommend these shoes."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro. Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG. I did receive a complimentary unit for an unbiased review, but honestly they would have been my first choice for purchase anyway. They have a loyal customer in me though I would be sure to let you know if they dropped the ball in any way with their products."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased these to help me make my boos stand tall and to avoid kinds and creases in tall boots. These inserts do the job. Just fold them and insert into the book shaft. They even work on my soft over-the-knee microfiber boots. I do, however, have 2 minor issues. The ""hook' mentioned in the description, is actually a loop of plastic. You would still need something like a hook to hang the boots off of a rod or another hook. The insert is also pretty slick and easily slides out of my boots, when I hold them by the loop.... so hanging from this loop may not be possible, to begin with. (Maybe I'm doing something wrong?) I ended up buying separate boot hangers and attached those to the boots AND inserts."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I love my DNS-325 so far.  At the moment, I have a single WD 2TB ""Green"" hdd installed.  I like the small footprint, the ease of installation, the web browser interface, and the power savings.  It boots up fast too.  And it's super quiet.

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years."

  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)

So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place.

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"genre: paranormal romance
setting: contemporary
format: collection of short stories

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,"This 6 th series is a real treat.  The characters are believable, the story is well-told, and the acting is superb.  The series is a must have for any fan of the series.  Highly recommended.I was excited to see this movie."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Working through training with one of our dogs and this is perfect. Flexible plastic makes it a bit more comfortable and it's easy to get on and off. With training methods our dog is getting used to it more and tolerating it on for longer periods of time. Also about $10 cheaper from Amazon than Petco.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is a high quality belt. it's comfortable, the black bands are stretchy, as well as having 2 adjusters to make the belt multiple different sizes. I love that it's waterproof, since we do a lot of hiking, and cross streams. I took a picture of my daughter's iphone 5c in the pocket to show how easily it fit. In my opinion, this is a great product. I will definitely get a lot of use out of this comfortable belt. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I highly recommend it."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

I purchased a copy of this book."

I just wish there was a way to go to the previous game with a game board so"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

**About the music:

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

Ballet + adagio classical music = peace + calm + relaxation

this dvd is the best when i need to forget about the world and just breathe and concentrate on movements."
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Very nice radio, except I can't see it during the day time.  The glare is unbelievable and it's so dim it can hardly be seen.

At night it's great, if not a little too bright.  The dim adjustments are not adequate for day/night.

Other than that it's a great sounding radio with plenty of features."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I really wish that I could like this heli. I own 10 heli's; 3-Drift Kings, excellent, 2- Syma 107s, excellent, 1- 109G, 1- 111G, all excellent, 1- Xieda radio x-trol, flyable, but only just, 1- JXD 338 Sky Wolf mid-size radio x-trol, clumsy but, it's pretty cool and it flies well. Now I own this JXD 339, which I had been eyeing for some time thinking, wouldn't it be cool if this one acted like a 3ch Drift King! But, in the product description, it doesn't say anything about it being a two speed, like the DK. I happened to read a review where some one mentioned that it was, and when I saw that, I ordered it. It is a nice looking heli! Mine came in gold, which is what I was hoping for. When I started flying it, I found that the rotation rate is very fast, but low speed is painfully slow, and high speed would not keep up with a stock 107. Every heli I've flown has it's own characteristics. Some are quick, others sluggish, some fast, others are touchy. This one is just plain weird! A curved left, in high speed makes it almost stop and spiral up. A right curve, if done just a little to fast, causes it to do a motorcycle-type high-side, causing the upper and lower blades to collide, causing an instant crash! As much as I want to like this one, I don't know how I'm going to make myself do that! Very Disappointed!"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We have been so excited to test out our new kite since it arrived a few days ago.  The weather finally cooperated today, and we were able to take it out for a test run.  First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

 After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!  I am more than impressed with the durability of this kite, and would definitely recommend it.  It's prefect for children and adults.

This lock has good build quality but I would not reccomend it for home defence.  The key is small and would be difficult to open in an emergency.  I also think the tendency would be to want to keep the key near the gun for an emergency.  This totally defeats the purpose of a trigger lock.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Both of my kids love Playmobil. I purchased this firetruck for my son. He loves this toy but also it'll frustrate him.
First of all, the front-window-compartment is very difficult for the kids to take off. The only way, to place a fireman on the drivers-seat is to take off this window-compartment. Second of all, the ladder comes off every time, my kids just touch it. A grown-up has to install it back on the firetruck. I don't know, why Playmobil couldn't come up with a different solution for this, but it's very frustrating for the kids, that it won't stay installed and they can't fix it themselves. The ladder won't stay up plus falls off the truck. The rest of the firetruck seems very sturdy and has bright colors. Love the sound-effects on it. Not too loud."

I purchased this because I was hoping I could wear it out and it wouldn't be so obvious that it's a nursing top, but it is obvious. It's not really flattering, it's a little frumpy looking in my opinion. That is the reason for only 3 stars. Functionally, however, it works well. It is easy to get in and out of and covers everything while baby is nursing. I have yet to find the perfect nursing top. For the price, I was hoping this would be it."

I discovered this the hard way in an airsoft game. The flashlight is at a good brightness as well. I would hazard something above 150 lumens, although this figure should not be quoted. It comes with a pressure switch as well, although I have no idea where I'm gonna place mine. Not the easiest device to operate if you don't have the pressure switch though. The laser proved to be an excellent intimidation tactic at the game, though, so I will definitely be bringing it on more of them. Shame about the battery, though. Not the most common batteries to be found, so I'll be a little bit of a pickle once mine run out.

You'll have to apply the stickers on yourself, though. This is not a difficult task, however."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I was all hyped to watch this movie in the theater and, to me, it was a let down. The movie is about a good, decent, hard working man  called Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) who looses his eldest son to gang rage.  It doesn't end there though--they want more.....
 Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence.  Which way to go????
I will say that his ultra-impressive performances in  ""The Woodsman"" and ""Mystic River"" are nothing like he shows in this movie.  No depth of character for Bacon, which I believe is his bread and butter in the acting field."
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,CG,"To call this movie Prisoner of Azkaban is a disgrace is to make it a glorified, self-serving, and often boring movie. The basic premise of the movie is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of drug dealers. He is brought to Azkaban for the crimes he commits. The movie also has a number of other problems. First, the film is very violent, with some extremely violent scenes. The acting is excellent, the writing is very good, and the script is very well written. The second problem is that the movie is very difficult to watch. It is like watching a movie from the 80's. The movie is filled with references to other movies and to a movie. This is not to say that this is not a movie for the average viewer. The movie is very violent, with some very violent scenes. The third problem is that the movie is very long. I would say that the movie is not as long as the previous movie. The movie is about 50 minutes. The movie is not as long as the first movie, but it is very long. The movie is also very long, and the movie is not as long as the first movie. The last problem is that the movie is not as good as the first movie, but it is very good. The movie is very long, and the movie is very well written. The final problem is that the movie is very hard to watch."

A one-eyed alien, a hard-drinking robot, a great-great-great-forever nephew and a brave new world to explore!  The first 13 episodes, each with full-length audio commentary which is as funny as the episodes themselves.  PLUS delected scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette and lots of other extras.  While the series is making fun of sci-fi, it is also sometimes very serious, dealing with issues of romance, sin and racism against robots.  OK, OK, the series doesn't take much of anything seriously.  There are suicide booths, Robot Washes, anchovies, a Robot Hell, New New York City, living heads, liquid aliens, addictive soft drinks and invasions of Earth."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"There has been so much anticipation and hype around Isla and the Happily Ever After. While I read it very quickly and enjoyed Stephanie Perkins ability to tell a good story, I just didn't love this one as much as everyone else did. Before you get confused by my 4-star rating, I'll start off with what I liked about it: the writing was well done, the pacing was good, the characters felt very natural, and it was very romantic at times (in a genuine, loving way -- not a sexual way). I read most of this book in about a day, and didn't feel like it was dragging at any point in the story. Moving on to the factors that deducted from the star rating. I just did not like Isla and Josh together. I felt that their relationship was not a healthy one and that they really didn't bring out the best in each other. I also disliked the Lola, Cricket, Anna, and St. Claire Cameos. For more details on exactly why these didn't work for me, check out my spoiler-filled book talk: https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=F1wls-wRfdc

I can't deny the appeal of Stephanie Perkins books. She sweeps you up in these whirlwind romance, and by and large, you genuinely believe in the couple's love. However, there is always something that really detracts from the story for me. In this one, I just didn't think the characters were a good match for each other. Still a great, fun, fast read, but I don't think it's quite as good as it's often made out to be. For more book reviews, discussions, and book-related fashions, visit http://www. abouttoread."
Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"Absolutely no customer service, try googling for a company website and you will not find a result. First, after opening the box there was 1 landing skid missing. Second, I tried the propeller guards on and spun the propellers by hand and one for the propellers would rub against the guard. So I tried charging the battery and was going to fly it without propeller guards, landing skids, and without the camera. Plugged the battery in and the drone never got power, no signal to the transmitter either. Tried calling their customer service (which was found on groupon) and they ask to send an email or leave a message. First I tried wrinting an email and after a week I never received a response, then tried calling and leaving a message and after 2 weeks I never received a response. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Beware of this hoax company. I will now try and google for company webpages before making any further purchases, regarding drone manufacturers. The cherry on top, after handling the body of the drone, the company name smeared from the palm of my hand. Very cheap and not worth the money. This would have been my 5th drone to play with, I have also built my own drones as well. Never had any other issues with other quadcopter companies. Since you can't find a company address or contact a customer service representative, I will probably order a new flight contoller and get it to fly myself, would hate the whole investment to go in the garbage."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"When Mark Wahlberg openly implies the mistake he made in taking on the role he played in this film, you know there's a serious problem.

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

To any potential viewers, be forewarned. There's not much of anything ""happening"" throughout this entire movie."

Yes, it has plenty of power and will hold the charge through all my projects!  He recommended that I just get a board and put screws in it, then reverse and take out.  I did....I only needed to do that twice before I was all over the inside and outside of my house taking care of those long-awaited projects.

With R Burton and E Taylor playing opposite, and caught on film, there was simply no reason to try it again.  I still wonder when anyone does.

These little devices are the same for line voltage connectors as Nichols and team were to Albee's play.  The technology has gone as far as it can.  They cost something, but just after my first installation I'm tempted to run around the house, opening and updating every junction box I can find.

The only problem I have with it is that I was unaware that the corners had elastic.  It is like putting a fitted sheet on a pool table.  Our past ones have not had that option.  It was not stated in the description.  The reason that this is a problem for me personally is that it is really a two person job to put it on.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,CG,"With two small kids now, this is an excellent addition to our growing collection. I would recommend. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do like about it is the size of the hat. My son is 4 and loves to play with it. He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up. The little one will probably love it for a while. I would buy this again, but maybe for a few more years. My son loves this car!  It is very well made and looks great on the wall. It is easy to put together and it is a great size!  My son loves it!My daughter loves this. She loves to play with it, but not the perfect size for her. I would say it is a little smaller than the other ones that she has that are larger. But it is adorable and it's so cute!My daughter LOVES this!!  She is a huge Star Wars fan and she loves this!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Unfolding like a thriller, Winged Obsession recounts the dogged efforts of U.S. Fish and Game agent Ed Newcomer to lasso his man, Yoshi Kojiyama, a Japanese butterfly smuggler who fancies himself the ""Indiana Jones of butterfly smuggling.""  You could not make up a character like Yoshi.  His personality is truly unique and could only exist in real life.  A fictional person such as he would be laughed off the page.
This book is so rich, filled with so many fascinating elements, and from the very beginning, the reader knows he will not be able to put it down.  Jessica Speart is an unusual combination of nature enthusiast  expert and mystery writer, which makes the varying elements of her story hang together so well.  The reader not only gets much information about butterflies and beetles, and the  black market world behind their collection, but also a ripping good story about a heroic agent who won't stop until he gets his man, no matter what it takes.  Included  is a description of his case against pigeon breeders that is totally apart from the central narrative and could support an entire book on its own.  This is also an entire treatise on the nature of obsession and the need to own the rare, the exotic, the item on the verge of extinction.  ""The rarer the more unusual, the fewer, and the weirder something is, the more it's in demand by people in the trade.""  There will be understandable comparisons to The Orchid Thief, but Winged Obsession is better written, more accessible, funnier and scarier than that one."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I cut this device a lot a slack in terms of criticism because it was so inexpensive (under $40).  It works as described and, with a little tedious fine tuning, it delivers a pretty clear picture.
But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception. When used with a Slingbox this camera makes a pretty neat nanny cam--the live feed can be viewed from any web browser or from a smart phone (e.g. iphone, blackberry) and can be recorded to PC if desired."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nine Lorien teenagers were sent to earth to await their legacies, special powers that each possess, in order to return to their planet to save it. Number Four, Daniel Jones, is moving from Florida to Paradise, Ohio, with his new name, John Smith, and his Cepan, or guardian, Henri.

In Paradise, John tries to start a life as he acquaints himself with Sarah Hart, a friendly, smart ex-cheerleader. Of course, with an ex-cheerleader there's an ex-boyfriend, Mark James, who isn't so happy about the chemistry between John and Sarah. As John begins to fall for Sara, she becomes another person who would be in danger from the Mogadorians, another alien race that are hunting the Lorien teens.

Each Lorien teen is at a different place on Earth. Three have already been caught and killed, which is made clear through the scars on each of the remaining teens' ankles. As another one dies, another scar will appear in order to determine who will be hunted next. Because of a charm, the nine teens must be killed in their chronological order. As number four, John knows he's next.

Despite its controversial co-author, one can't argue that I AM NUMBER FOUR reads just like a script, so it's no surprise that it has been turned into a movie. The novel itself has scenes that are so action-packed, with a little romance thrown in, that it will captivate readers of all ages.

With the sequel, THE POWER OF SIX, releasing in August 2011, only read I AM NUMBER FOUR if you are willing to become addicted to another series.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to. Oh and I know the price of the whole 10 light system is the best anywhere at Amazon."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"I obtained an advance reader's copy of this book some time ago and had several false starts trying to read it.
My first attempt was on an Orlando to LAX flight - I literally had nothing else to do but open the book and read.
Somehow, I just couldn't get into it.  Some books draw you in and hold on to you even after you're finished.  This is certainly not one of those types of books.

My second attempt was in a car dealer's waiting room.  I opted to wait for my car.  Due to an unexpected delay finding a specific part, my estimates one hour wait turned into a 3 hour wait.  Again, I resumed reading this book yet couldn't manage to make myself turn the pages.  I read a couple more chapters but still couldn't muster enough interest to continue.

Then I find myself on another coast to coast flight, this time in a comfy seat up front.  Near the endpoint of the flight, my seat-neighbor asks me how the book is...I told him that I have tried to read it several times but I can't seem to garner enough interest.  I mentioned that I fell asleep twice trying to force myself to read the pages.  I also told him of my plan to review it on Amazon and that it would not be fair to review the work until I have properly read it.

All of that said, I finally did sit down and read the book.  Yes, the first third seems to plod along.  The book does pick up some, probably because I developed a form of literary Stockholm syndrome being a slave to its pages.

Overall - the novel's plot development is slow.  The characters, and there were too many of them, were not especially memorable for me.  The whole thing was predictable.  I would not recommend this book."

And if you lay them on their sides, there's always the chance the stopper you're using won't be as secure as you'd hoped, and you end up with a leaky mess. This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string. If you don't, you are lucky to get them in and out of the water a few times."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Lush Life is the 8th book in the Samantha Jamison Mystery series and although each book is a standalone they do somewhat follow from the last I'm lead to believe. This was my first taste of the book series and I'd quite like to read the others at some point. I was a little worried that I wouldn't get into it, but from the beginning you feel like you're part of the sleuth clan and not just the reader.

This book series is based around Samantha or Sam to her friends that is a mystery novelist that turns the crimes she solves, with the help of her friends, into novels. It all started when she didn't get the information she wanted on how her husband died so solved it with the help of a PI named Clay. The Lush Life sees herself being dropped in it when Clay agrees to house sit for a wealthy couple in New Hope they'd both met previously but he couldn't do it due to a prior engagement and so left the house in her capable hands.

As the story continues Sam finds that more and more interesting characters are turning up at the house, some supposedly working for the Worths and others supposedly sent by Clay. But something isn't quite right and so we find ourselves trying to help solve the ever evolving mystery. We are continuously left guessing who could be the culprit.

It really is a fun humorous mystery unlike some that's out there with a mix of other things too like romance, it's perfect for anyone. It keeps the readers interest to the last page making it hard to put down. There is no way you can guess who did it until you reach the final page."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This excellent novel explores the tensions between the sexes in the 1800s. Though no one who reads Atwood should be surprised by her orderly, logical, deeply considered characterization, Grace Marks is a new high in Atwood's repetoire. Atwood's word play also flits around the book, and riffs on certain terms reflect and reverberate with studied meaning. I won't spoil it any more for you. It's an excellent book.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 18 month old grandson loves this toy as do his two older sisters. They all love music, singing and dancing, and this toy has given them hours of pleasure as they listen and sing along to some of their favorites like ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes."" Plus included in the box are the lyrics to the songs just in case, as an adult, you don't know them! You'll be singing ""If You're Happy and You Know it"" with embarrassing frequency as it tends to stay in your head just like when the song came out!

The kids are able to record their own songs as well as sing to the five included prerecorded ones. The mirror is fun for the baby to laugh and giggle at himself as he watches the girls dance around the room singing in the microphone.

A plus for parents or adults is that the toy is easy to put together! The four legs snap into the base and are held there with a screw. No complicated diagrams or instructions.

If your child loves music, this is a great durable toy that can provide hours of fun and will hold up under toddler play!"

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

* * * * * 01.30.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

* * * * * 02.11.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

Trakdot is, without question, the worst purchase decision I've ever made, but at least I got my money back. Finally."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"READ THIS BOOK!!!

I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. He was required to read this book for a college economics class. I absolutly fell in love with this book. I do not read much, so an 1100 page book is a big undertaking for me. I will pass on what my friend told me:  The first 200 pages will seem slow because of the character discriptions and history. Give it those 200 pages and you will be hooked and it will read a lot faster. It is amazing that one person could compile everything that is in this book. What a work of art. As a reader, you will definetly start looking at the issues surrounding you in a different light. Only negative:  ""The Speach"" at the end of the book. It's way too long winded and over the head. Suggestion:  Listen to this speach on youtube to help get through it."

They rivalry and fighting to get the other gets to a one point that one of them is ready to drop off all pass feuds,cause she's having guilty thoughts for what had done to the other one. The story is funny ,humorous and make you think that sometimes that no everything you see or hear about it is true.

I figured they would destroy it in minutes, but, oddly enough it's still relatively intact and entertaining them three days later. That's a minor miracle around here.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Let me preface this review with noting that I absolutely LOVE books where a dog or animals are the main or central character.

The Art of Racing in the Rain is nothing more than the political, social and anti-science commentary of the author who disguises such as being told or observed by Enzo, the dog in the book. I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially given the many rave reviews this book garnered, but I was highly disappointed with many aspects of this book.

Analogies to racing (automobile) are exceptionally redundant, and the characters were, I thought, not well developed in the least. The story plods along with Enzo seeing the world through his eyes (and the shortcomings of not possessing thumbs), which had promise; but unfortunately the author uses the canine as an outlet for his own political and social commentary.

Yes, there were a few chuckles throughout, but sadly, the book is more a success of exceptional marketing rather than exceptional writing or storytelling.

As mentioned, I love books where the dog or animals are the main character(s): If Only I Could Talk, White Fang, The Call of the Wild, The Wind in the Willows and many others. Unfortunately, The Art of Racing in the Rain, although it held promise, falls very short if you are a fan of these types of books."

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,CG,"The wood I got was a little too thick and thin for my puppy, so I ended up using a pair of the same bedding. The dog was a little too strong for this bedding, so I bought a large, bedding that would hold up to the heat. It was a great buy, and it has held up to the heat well. I also use it on my dogs when I'm away from the house, because it's easier to carry around than the other ones I've used. The material is nice and thick, so I feel it's a great value. I would definitely recommend this bedding. I'm not a fan of the cover on the back, but it's nice and thick, and my dog is comfortable with it. I wish it had the cover on the top, but I'm glad I didn't."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I've recently upgraded my marker to the Q Loader, after doing something searching around I found out that the NXe harness is the best to hold extra Q Pods so I went ahead and bought this. The pockets on this harness is really well made, my Q Pods can slide in and out with no problem yet when they are inside it's a really good fit so even when I wear this upside down for quicker release they still won't fall out while running in the woods. I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future. The velcro on the front is of very good quality, the contact surface area is big enough and I never have to worry about it falling off. I do, however, wish it was regular camo instead of digital, would match my shirt better but that's a minor hitch, wasn't described fully on the page but not really a big deal to me. Overall this is an excellent product, like I said before I got this mainly for my Q Pods and they are a great fit with this so I'm extremely happy with that, and if anyone who's in the same boat as me looking for a harness for your Q Pods, this is it!"

The beginning of the season was pretty much just a matter of the movie ending, which was a little long and seemed to be coming from the writers' imagination. I guess it just seemed like a lot of people were so bored with Star Trek. This season seemed to be pretty good. I don't know if I'm going to watch this again, but I will. I love the characters, the story, the special effects, the acting. I really liked the actors, the humor, the dialog. I just wish that they could have given the actors more of a chance to develop their characters. I would recommend this season to anyone. I really hope that they get a chance to add more episodes to the series. I really enjoyed this season of Star Trek."

Title: Phoenix (Cora)

Rating: 4
Rating: 4.5 stars

What a fantastic story! This book is packed full of drama, heartache and heartbreak.  The characters are well developed and the characters are full of love.  I was thoroughly impressed with the way the author made it through the book.  I loved the ending, but I wish there was more.  I have a hard time putting down this book.

I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.  Thanks for a great story.I was a little confused at first, but I did like it. I liked the characters, but I didn't like the way the story ended. I wanted to know if it was okay with the author or not. I was a little disappointed that the ending ended, but not that I was expecting. I thought the author was a good writer, but not a great author. I liked the idea of the book, but didn't like it.I am always a little skeptical of how this book will play out in the future.  I loved it, but it took a little while to get into it.  I think it is a great read, but I would have liked to have read more from this author.  I will definitely be reading more by this author.This is a short novella. I read it in one sitting, but I am not sure if I will finish it before"

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This book gives you a very specific guide on how to do your own mini-farm, it's really detailed so this book is really for beginners. I've been trying several days to star my own mini farm and this book gave me the tips to be able to really do it! It's really easy to read and understand."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.
While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.
Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father.
While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances. The remastered copy is easier on the eyes."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,work great and hold a charge for a dozen uses
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is another great black comedy.  It's one of those stories where there's a groundwork that has to be established to continually build up the level of humor.  At first, I couldn't quite figure out where the story was going, but I stayed with it, and it grew crazier and funnier (and funnier still) over time, with constant twists and turns, as the disparate elements of the storyline came together.  It has a stellar cast who play the bizarre, off-beat characters -- roles that many of these actors are extremely skilled at and are well known for.  Like most black comedies, it has a good deal of violence and strong language, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea.  But, I loved it!"
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Got the item, and was excited since I needed to verify all the cables in my house.  Started using it, and it worked for checking 3-4 cable runs, green lights would line up (make sure you check the receiver unit, as it needs to blink the green lights in the correct order).  Then after that the power light on the main unit just stayed solid, couldn't get it to work after that.  Tried changing batteries, etc, nothing.

For the price it's a great deal, but if you need to rely on it, you might want to look elsewhere or buy two just in case."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Great mount to hold either a cable box, DVD Player, or Bluray Player. We combined this with the adjustable VideoSecu TV Mount and they look great together. What is also nice is the arms on this bracket are adjustable to accomodate all ranges of media sizes. Highly recommend if you just want a way to mount a peice of media without have to have a full shelf."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"The bad:  it is a pain to turn on and off with heavy gloves on.  The app is worthless and is incredibly difficult to get the app to recognize the unit even after it is connected in the bluetooth menu.

The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.  They are too bulky to fit in my jacket pocket for work (plus require spare batteries) so they don't really compete well for most applications."

I also have a very heavy blade with a very sharp edge and it is difficult to get the knife out of the sheath. I hope the knife is a good value for the money. This is a very good quality, and very well made. The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot use it as a gun, but it does work as a handgun. I would recommend it for a gun like a Ruger or M&P-15. I have used this for years. I bought the first one for my wife and she loves it. She is a 5'6"" woman and the other one for her daughter."

A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,Fantastic product!  I bought this to replace an old HDD that came with my Dell laptop.  It is so small that it's not portable and takes up a lot of space. 
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This works wonderfully to play your music and it comes out very clear and loud.  Very easy to hook up and start using right away.  The light for the radio station is a little dim and in the sun it was hard to tell it was on.  For phone calls I honestly couldn't tell if the sound was coming out of my phone or the stereo until I hit mute on my stereo.  It was very hard to hear.  I tried several different calls and it was not working well but when I hung up and the music came back on nice volume.  It would have been fewer stars had I care about the call part of it.  I got this for my husband's car for road trips as his does not have aux or bluetooth and sometimes you can't get a station in or whatever reason and you want to hear music through the stereo speakers rather than the cell.  So for my purposes it is great.
I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike."

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin."

I usually do a lot of research before making a purchase and that includes reading reviews.  If Im making my decision based solely on reviews Ill determine  whether the information that the reviewer is giving is important to me based on what I am looking for.  One person may think something is good/bad and write a review based on their opinion.  Those comments may or may not be relevant to my use for that item.  What they think is great I may not find as relevant, or vice versa.  The biggest things for me when assessing a product is the quality, well made or not?  Does it function as stated.  Is it easier or harder to use? etc.  If you have any questions leave it in comments and I will respond.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!"

I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my dog. I have a 40lb Chihuahua. She has a lot of loose hair and this product is good for her.

The characters are just a little too quirky for me, and I could not relate to any of them. The plot is depressing. The writing is rather stilted. I realized that I can't remember how it ended, so I just pulled it off the bookshelf. I guess the fact that I never got past page 134 tells it all.

Well, one in my fathers Samsung Galaxy S2 died 10-15 days ago, and the one in my Samsung Galaxy S3 just died today, 2/20/2013. It seems they have a short life span - just 5 months, or I was just lucky enough to get 2 bad ones.

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

The plot and events just didn't flow as well as they had in past books in the series.

So I thought no big deal I will use them on my deck.  Only 2 of the lights work.  I have changed the batteries in all of them. In the inside something will not make contact with the light.  I contacted the seller and there was no restitution to the problem.  So I use the casing and I put tea lights in them.

It's not like the lock button is in an easy to reach place with one's fingers...nope, it's right at the top of the device, making it impossible to safely reach around, up, or over with the same hand, thus rendering this once single-hand device useless as a single-hand device.
You really hosed this one, Cuisinart, and it's probably because you had to because some twat stuck their finger in the blades at one time, so now the rest of us suffer thanks to idiots."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.

The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.

At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.

In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)

That's... really... bad script writing! You almost have to admire it!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"When the story begins, we are in the mind of Elsie, a smart, funny and sarcastic if a bit average teenager. Elsie and her sister, Julie, (Elizabeth and Jane Bennet) who is one year older than she are have moved from their home in Massachusetts and are going to a new prep school called Coral Tree. There, they meet Chase and Chelsea Baldwin (a.k.a. Charles and  Caroline Bingley) and Chase's friend, Derek Edwards (Will Darcy), a handsome, guy who happens to have famous parents. Elsie immediately pegs him as a rich jerk, with girls fawning over him and guys wanting to be him. She also makes friends with Webster Grant, a clever funny guy who, for some reason Derek hates. As the story unfolds, you learn the stories between why Derek is so sheltered, why he hates Webster, and who he really is. This was the best remake of Pride and Prejudice I have ever read, it is true to the story but, still not predictable and leaves you anticipating the characters actions.  Lazebnik did not just take Elizabeth and Will, rename them, and stick them in a modern-day high school, she molded and tweaked them, but only slightly, to fit the setting and story. I still love/like Elizabeth, Jane, Darcy, Georgia and Mr. Benton, still am annoyed by Lydia and Mrs. Benton, and still despise Caroline (Does not have Mr. Collins).  There is some romance and cussing, but nothing very bad. I really enjoyed this book and loved watching Elsie and Derek grow as characters until the very end. This was so good, I truly encourage you to pick this up and start reading."

I never know quite what to say in these reviews, as I hate to be a spoiler, but I can say that I read Sugar in one sitting, having postponed weekend plans to do so .

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.
My wife loves this unit... I have heard her use it several times late at night. Now her running friends 'join' in on the boxing fun."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a bit late with this review. I've had this watch for almost 2 years and I love  it!! I had been wanting a white ceramic watch for the longest time. I wanted a Michael Kors one but I always hear how delicate they are and you have to be extra cautious with them- the slightest slam on a surface will make it break. My aunt got this watch with the Rose Gold frame and she wears it daily with no problems so I got myself one. Even though this watch is much cheaper than an MK watch it's so durable and worth it. I haven't had any problems with the quality.
The only negative thing I have to say is I have had for less than 2 years and I had to get the battery changed once but I figure it's been running since before I purchased it so it's a minor complaint. I just got it changed within the month so I'll see if it's lasts more than 2 years this time like it should."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This truck is a blast. First truck after not having one for 20 years. It didn't take me long before I was bashing this one and hard. First thing to replace if you like big jumps are the shocks and to go with them, 30wt oil. Trust me, the combo makes a big difference. Next thing will be the tires. The stock ones do a good job of keeping the truck from flipping at high speed turns but overall they wear out fast and need replacing. Proline has a great line of tires and woke my truck up a lot. I ran mine on a 2s battery for a long time, for trailing and bashing that's plenty quick and will prolong your parts. I did recently start running 3s and geared it up. A lot faster and I'm seeing quite a bit of wear on the front and rear differentials. The great thing about traxxas, all your parts and upgrades are usually in stock and ready to order. Every single hobby store that I've gone to has parts. All that aside the reason I give them five stars is not only are there line of RC vehicles really good but their customer service can't be touched. They are simply amazing. Anytime I've had questions they've been super nice and answer them, anytime I needed parts that were still under warranty they shipped me new ones immediately, any time I had any question about upgrades they were absolutely awesome. I have yet to talk to someone over there who is having a bad day. While I do have a large assortment of RC vehicles from different companies I would definitely say if you're starting out Traxxas can't be beat. If you're even an Enthusiast who loves to have a good basher Traxxas is definitely worth a look into. My stampede is a great all around basher and one I have no plans of replacing."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better."

And the bus happens to be on an ordinary, crowded big city highway. So once you realize ( very early on in the movie ) that the bus is definitely *not* going to blow up, you can enjoy the ride. So once we're handed the simple, bare-bones scenario, we get to see every single complication that can occur with one speeding bus, scared people, and public roads. Every single possibility of loss of life and horrible danger is explored in loving detail. That is where this movie gets really fun: just sit back and enjoy the ride. That's all you have to do with this movie."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Cool factor: 9
Practicality factor: 2"
Electronics_5,2.0,CG,"Well, first of all, I use it as an external HDD for my computer, and I have a 512GB external hard drive in the back.  The drive itself is solid, and it's pretty solid.  It's a little thin, but it's not heavy.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that it's not a micro-USB port, which is a nice feature.  Other than that, it's a nice little drive.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this drive.  It's a solid drive, and it's solid.  It's a nice little drive.I bought this because it has the right size for my tablet and I like the color and the fact that it has a USB charging port. It's not for everyone, but for those who don't have an external charger, this is a good option.

I don't recommend this to anyone who wants to use a USB charging port on their tablet, but for those who do, this is a great option.

It's great to see ""old"" friends from previous MIB books and the introduction of 2 new characters gives me hope that more stories are to follow.

I won't say a lot as I do not do spoilers. But imagine if governments wanted to breed certain traits into a new breed of humans. And not good traits and there you have the premise of the story. Works very well too.

The battery compartment is not strong enough to hold an 8 cell battery, so if you have a battery that is not strong enough, it will not last long. I am still looking for a replacement battery.

I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!
I think they work very well for the price, and for being just a standard filter cartridge. They're nothing fancy, but I'm satisfied with how they work. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This screw driver is an all in one wonder and a must for any tool box or tool belt!

Pros: The body of the screw driver is fat for good torque, and the handle is easy on the hands. The tips are hard and durable so they will last for a long time. It takes the place of at least four normal screw drivers that one would need, plus it has several specialty bits that are nice to carry around.

Cons: Its heavier than a regular screw driver it's size, but when you think about it, it's taking up the roles of 10 tools.

To me, this 10-in-1 is worth every penny and more. It's built with Klein quality and I have no complaints. I highly recommend it to any one for home or commercial use."

It's a little thin on him, but he doesn't seem to mind it at all. He's a bit heavier, but he's still able to roll around and jump up and down. This harness has held up pretty well. It's easy to clean, and he doesn't have to worry about getting the harness tangled up in his chest. It's not a big deal, but it's a nice extra-large size for him. I have two dogs.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,CG,"I bought two of these and both work fine. I will keep one for the other one. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, but it is not as bright as the old one. I have to use a larger diameter bulb, which is a lot better. It has more of a fluorescent look, but I like the look more. I like that the bulb is longer than the old one, which is nice. I use the same bulb twice a day, and use it daily. It is more of a ""screwdriver"" type of light. The reason I like this bulb is because it has a longer diameter, which makes it easier to carry around. Also, the light is pretty bright, so I'm happy with the light. I don't really like the color of the bulb, but it is pretty cool. I bought a couple of these for my son's bedroom. He loves it. He loves the way it lights up his room.

It's a little bigger than a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a more compact flashlight, this is the one. The price is great for this light. You can buy it for around $20 for about $100. You can't beat the price for a good flashlight. It's not as big as a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a compact flashlight, this is the one. I've had it for a while now and I have no complaints. The review is my honest opinion. I gave it 4 stars because I was skeptical of the light.

I just want a flashlight that will last. I have a few other reviews that I would recommend. I will update this review after I get more information. This is a good product.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,CG,"To set the expectation straight, it's an impressive addition to our collection of interactive toys. The other two we've purchased are a solid and sturdy box with a cover, and a nice, sturdy wooden box with a clear cover. The box is very sturdy and well made. We've purchased several others, and it's a great addition to our collection. It's made of very high quality materials, and the box is very sturdy. It's very easy to open and close, and it's very durable. I love that it has a ""stiff"" lid to keep it from sliding open. The box has a ""cradle"" lid on the front, and it's well made.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,CG,This is a short novella that takes you on a journey of discovery and discovery. I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review. The author is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading more of her work. I enjoyed this story. I liked the characters and the storyline. I found myself with a feeling of danger in the end. It was a fun read. I liked the ending. I liked the fact that the two main characters were a good couple. I liked the fact that the author gave the reader a good story line. This was a great book. It was fast paced and well written. The characters were well developed. It was a fun read. I have read this author before and she is not my favorite. I found it a bit hard to believe that she would write this book for me. I will be reading the next one. I have not read the previous book and it is not my favorite. I am not sure if this author has had a chance to do a better job of writing this book. I will have to wait for the next one. I was very disappointed in this book. It was not a great book but it was a great book. I would recommend this book to everyone. I have enjoyed reading the series and this one had me wanting more.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"We have the all-metal version of this bed in our dog's cage and LOVE IT. We wanted something a little lighter weight and easier to move for downstairs so we went with this PVC version. Still a fantastic bed - Incredible quality and materials, but the PVC version definitely bows a little on the longer sides when our 55lbs Vizsla lays on it. So far (2 weeks in), they've sprung right back and there's no sag at all in the material, but I'm a little worried about down the road. Especially since the large bed is rated for 100lbs I think.  For the extra $30, I'm glad we have the aluminum one in her cage.  It has stood up to DETERMINED chewing, scratching and gnawing without any indications of wear except a small (quarter-size) bit of chipped/gnawed off paint on the corner piece."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Assembling the unit takes about 5 minutes.  You will need one 7/16"" wrench (or ratchet or crescent wrench or 11 mm wrench) to tighten the nylock nuts that hold everything together.  As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.  My gutter-cleaning problems are now over.

Side note:  I agree with another reviewer that the sheet-metal edges are very sharp and could definitely use a little sanding."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Denons ear-bud headphones are simple, comfortable to wear, and offer high sound quality.

The Denons are understated, but stylish.  They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents.  The materials and the fit and finish are high.  Included with the headphones are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large.  Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for.  I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s.

The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inches down from the right ear-bud.  The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command.  Its very intuitive and simple to use.

Sound quality of the Denons is high.  I listened to all types of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice.  Bass was strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered.  Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound.  Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I was also able to hear subtle instruments and vocals that I would have missed otherwise.  The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times.

The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tips fit my average sized ears best.  The headphones fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit.  Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity levels they should work fine.  They are also light in weight.  The cord is long enough to not tug on the headphones when you move, but not so long that it gets in the way.

All in all you cant ask for much more from ear-buds."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I use these for cycling.  I ride in the city as well as in the woods, so these are great for going from bright sun and then into the shade.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I know:  many viewers resented the apparent lack of physical chemistry between the characters played by Connery and Zeta-Jones.  Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and  Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of  Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual,  and sexual ?  I find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people  enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the  same thing ! - but as it happens in life, people perform so much better  when they really like what they do.  The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones  youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident, more inward  quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime  experience.  As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the  old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.  Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of  his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.  While, at  the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually  liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between  Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair  and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with  occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.  Watch and  enjoy the movie, as I did, for what it is not for what it is not !"

He has always been a puller and these collars seem to withstand that. They don't fray.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"My wife recently endured ""The Big C"" herself in real life and wanted to see this show, so I bought the first season for her to view.  Having gone through her ordeal with her (and thus being labeled a ""caretaker""...who really took care of whom?, is my question) I sat down and watched these DVDs with her.  This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.  Watch this series if you want to know how NOT to act if you have the Big C...you'll not only learn a few lessons, you'll be entertained as well."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The Birthday Supplies Kit is such a great idea and will cover your bases for any small (8 or fewer) people at a birthday party. The kit includes what you need for eating & drinking--plates, napkins, cups and plastic cutlery, as well as the decorations--tablecloth, small centerpiece, balloons, streamers and curling ribbon. Oh yeah, and 12 candles!! My tablecloth is the cute panda table cloth, not red like the photo. It's actually much cuter and matches the plates and napkins in design. The whole setup looks great, buttoned up and complete.

In my experience with birthday parties, if you were having more kids than 8, it would be more affordable and less wasteful to supplement this set with extra plates & forks than to buy a second set. And most kids don't ever touch their napkins... Don't forget the hand wipes though, always good to have on hand.

This set is so useful and saved me a trip to the store, time and gas. If you got this stuff at Target, it would be so much more expensive too. However, this same stuff at the Dollar Store would only total $10-13 (plus tax if applicable) if you bought this ala carte. It could be extra from the extra cutlery. Anyway, I love this set and totally appreciate how it saved me time and money and left nothing behind."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it."

I live in a very rural area where guinea pigs as pets are pretty much unheard of so finding a small animal vet for my babies was difficult and we have to drive about 30min to get there.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Whatever there is to ""like"" about a radon mitigation fan, one ""needs"" it if the radon level is high.  I bought this unit to replace a competitor's unit that suffered a bearing failure after 2 weeks of service.  The original radon fan from this same competitor had been in service for 22 years.  Now, I don't think there is any real difference between this unit and the one that failed--they sure look similar--I think it was just bad luck with the first one.  But I wasn't prepared to  replace the failed unit with the same model so I ordered this one which has been working well so far.  I give it 4 stars because I think the price is higher than what it should be.  I paid the higher price because of my bad luck with the cheaper brand."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,I bought this to use with my tablet and games I own because in some games it would be much easier to use a controller than pressing the screen like Metal Slug. Unfortunately the maker states more compatibility than it really has. I can get some games to kinda work and others don't work with it at all. It says there is tons of games on the market it is compatible with but only shows me 20 and I don't own any of them. I am currently trying it with other controller programs and some of them could work it better than Nyko's own program which is frankly sad. I want to be able to use and love this controller more and hope Nyko improves their program and compatibility more.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it. She was supposed to get the full dose twice a day for two to three weeks before going down to a maintenance dose of 1/4 teaspoon once or twice a week. So, I did the math, and the next day put 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) in her food, and after a couple of suspicious sniffs, she ate her food without complaint. This equals out to two full doses (1/2 of a teaspoon) every eight days, which is right around the maintenance level. She (and her two brothers) have managed to eat this without issue for several weeks now. She's had a few issues, where I thought perhaps the UTI was recurring, but they were only minor blips, and otherwise, she's been just fine, so I'm very pleased. When used a a preventative, at the maintenance dose, this stuff seems to do the trick! I plan to keep them all on this and am hoping for no further issues."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."

Overall, this is a fun toy that my 3-year-old son will enjoy. It is fairly simple to play and we have enjoyed it for years. I would recommend this toy for anyone who enjoys the 3D graphics and the music.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Forget that this is War and Peace and just enjoy it as an excellent Hollywood movie.  If you want something that approximates Tolstoy's War and Peace, then check out the Russian adaptation made in 1968.  The 1956 Hollywood version is under-appreciated; the 1968 Russian version is over-praised.  It's a pity that we couldn't have the heart of the 1956 version and the intelligence of the 1968 wrapped up in the same film.

The solution:  If you want Tolstoy's War and Peace, then read it.  It's a long novel, but it not a difficult novel. But as far as movies go, the Hollywood treatment works well.

A few years have passed since I wrote the above review.  I liked the film even better on a third viewing.  It's not Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, but it's a good movie.  Think of it as another Gone With the Wind.  Maybe this War and Peace only deserves 4 stars, but Audrey Hepburn always rates an extra star or two."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,Finally Declan and Harper get their story!! I enjoyed going back to Hell to see Declan get his fiesty independent woman. Watching single mom Harper give in and give her heart a chance was something I could totally relate to. It wasn't easy for these two to come together but nothing is in the tiny town of Hell but you will totally root for them. And it was nice to get updates on the friends who are family to Declan and Harper. A hot read I definitely recommend. A little slow to get going but an enjoyable stand alone read.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Yes, this is a new writing style for the talented MS EDWARDS.  She has shown more talent than when she wrote as MS NICOLE EDWARDS. And, I didn't know that there ever was that much talent had existed.  Being able to write books that are that good and being that different is phenomenal. We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I URGE YOU TO READ THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE SERIES.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SERIES.
SO, GET THE BOOK AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

HAPPY READING MY BOOK FRIENDS......."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I'd checked other options since last summer, and have acquired enough 2 liter seltzer bottles to start a bottle tower garden.
Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher."

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

Tessa and Hideo had such a great"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.

Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...

I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these cool white bulbs expecting a passable incandescent replacement. What I got was six bright Fully Dimmable bulbs for less than a third of the cost of the 100w GE dimmable I bought last year. They're also smaller, lighter and run cooler. They dim to 10%, while the more expensive GE bulb barely dims to 40%. I love it when a product exceeds my expectations and seeing the word dimmable on the box was a wonderful surprise. For some reason the lifetime is rated as 22.8 years at 3 hours a day. That comes to a total of 2.85 years or about 25000 hours. At the price that's still a bargain."

It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared.

It comes in a pack of 10, which is so nice, because I have them in my emergency kit in the cars and the house. Each blanket comes individually wrapped in it's own ziploc type bag for easy storage.

They are also waterproof and weather proof. Hopefully I will never have to use them in an emergency, but it puts my mind at ease knowing I have them and that they work really well!!

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. If you have a previous version of Quickbooks and want to know any gotcha's about what happens to your data while upgrading (or how to get your data migrated into the new version) this is not the guide. If you are concerned about advanced topics such as 64-bit systems or server-based versus desktop-based or how to lock it down so everyone in the company doesn't have to be a super-user just to use the software this type of information does not appear to be in this book. There is some coverage on managing users in chapter 26 but little on how to make multi-user work so more than one person can use the software at a time and what the issues/limitations are,

I think it would be great if the story line would have been more developed. I am hoping that the author will take this author to the next level. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I really looked forward to getting these having read the reviews but so far have found them awkward in the following ways:
1. The fenders tend to warp easily meaning that if they follow the cross-section curvature at the brake end, they will be way off center at the mud flap end.  You can do a limited amount of adjusting but so far I haven't managed to get it quite right
2. Creep - be careful and don't try to get them too close to the tire - no closer than 3/8ths of an inch, otherwise with vibration the forward end of the blade will creep down towards the tire and several times I have caught it between the tire and the brakes.  I would recommend keeping the blade about 3/4 of an inch from the rear brake.
3. I use these only occasionally - in Colorado we don't have much rain, so they are on and off, mainly during the winter - they are easy to install, but I do seem to have to spend a lot of time aligning them properly.  Might be easier for someone who leaves them on for longer periods - I don't know.

The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category."

The author jumped from person to person so quickly it makes your head spin, and it was hard to keep track who was who. There was no electricity between Salander and Blomkvist, in fact they had hardly anything to do with each other. The author didn't let you inside anyone's heads, including the main characters.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I definitely had a love, hate relationship with this  book. When I began to read  the book I wasn't very impressed at all. I couldn't really figure out who was who and what the story was really about. So I decided that I needed to continue on in order  to give a fair review. I'm so glad I did. The author has written a very intricate mystery that  kept me guessing throughout the book. The action is explosive and at times very intense.

Jake is a former Marine who has  a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings. I thought his  character was good and had lots of depth. He is smart, decisive, alert and had great instincts. He has a new job as a photojournalist. While following someone he inadvertently stumbles upon an assassin  at large. The assassin does  not like lawyers .  Jake seems to get one step ahead and then takes two steps back in this lively story. Who is the assassin? Why are lawyers being targeted?

I thought the assassin  was a brilliant character because he was so unpredictable. He reminds me of a ticking time bomb. You never know when it will go off but you know when it does , chaos follows. I liked the multidimensional, quirky and very unnerving characteristics he had. What I really like was how the assassin even controlled the people who hired him. With cutting words he was in control and calculated his every move. He does some very ingenious things to divert the attention away from him and on to Jake. Will Jake be able to prove who the assassin is? I recommend this book to mystery lovers who like intrigue and characters that jump off the pages with intensity.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Best Laid Plans is like no other book I've read before. The story is action packed, raw, gritty and beyond entertaining. There are funny bits, and of course romance. But the best part is the two awesome main characters.

Stylo's writing style is one of my favorites. She captures your attention from the first pages of her books and this one is not different. At the same time, this book is nothing like her others. I felt like I was watching an action movie while reading it. Her attention to details and how well researched everything in her books is doesn't go unnoticed. It makes the experience of reading this book feel much more real.

The story is incredibly well written. The descriptions of the places make you feel as if you're there. The characters are intriguing, and captivating. Marc and Lily are headstrong, brave and they are focused on getting their respective jobs done. These two make quite the dynamic duo. They had me clutching my heart, laughing and swooning.

Not only the main characters are intriguing, the side characters as well. Kingsley, is I have to say, one of my favorite things about his book, and I'm hoping we get a lot more from him.

They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed as the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No."

The storage inside is divided into 3 removable trays. You can put a lot of tools, gardening equipment, etc. inside. My favorite part is the removable power cord with 4 outlets.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Daisy's friend, Chloe, invited her to her book launch party. Since Chloe's book is based on Daisy of course she goes to the party. Too bad the party was a bust. There weren't many people attending but the ones that did go sure made it a memorable night.

Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses! When he was later found dead there were so many suspects it was going to take the police a long time to find the murderer. Daisy couldn't let her friend, Chloe, be declared guilty so she decided to find out who the real killer was. Detective Stern was handling the case but he wasn't happy about Daisy's interference in the investigation.

I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite. I thought it was slow starting with the first 20% or so giving information about Daisy that wasn't necessary. In general, this book wasn't as interesting as the others in this series.

The best book in the series so far has Maddies best friend (book 1) Tabitha shacking up with Maddies old boss and regular hook up Barrett. Then the night Tabitha meets Barretts family, everything changes and she is forced to leave him and packs up everything to buy a house in the same small town as Maddie.

Maddie has no idea of Tabitha and Barretts relationship and when it is revealed chaos ensues.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

In this book, Ford infiltrates a government-run facility which has built the world's largest particle accelerator for a mere $40 billion. (Please suspend your disbelief.)  I like the way Preston has worked together several subplots which all culminate at the end of the book for a complex climax. I am also a fan of Preston's easy writing style--it's good for a quick read. I am not a fan of Preston's portrayal of Born Again Christians--I think it's a bit over-the-top, though I guess it's a reasonable depiction of a very small percentage of rapture-ready Christians. Also, Preston is clearly not a physicist, but I guess not everyone can be perfect. :) Overall, I think Blasphemy was good for a quick sci-fi/techno read, but shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

I appreciated the insert showing the various features, but wondered why a power adapter (DC5V,500mA, whatever THAT is!) wasn't included to charge the unit.  Manufactures would be well-advised to remember that Baby Boomers still want to get out camping, or maybe even just upgrade our emergency gear.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.

Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.

Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.

Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!

Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"One of the best books on dreamwork I have ever read, and I have read a few. The book is not only informative, but well structured, well written, and very didactic. It is based on Jungian Psychology and therefore it does discuss a a few things about the matter, but does not enter in the different schools of dream interpretation. If you are into Jungian psychoanalysis this book os for you.

The book gives you tools to approach and interpret your own dreams and to approach and develop Visualization (Creative Imagination, as it is called here) with ease and depth.

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"We purchase these cute little shoes for our little son and since he is a boy we chose this navy blue and white combination for him.  It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.  Anyway, overall, this is a very worthy purchase.  It actually has a bit of room for his feet to grow into which is nice for it means that he will be able to use these for a longer period of time.
I was able to get this very nice item on a discount and I am glad to share to you all as well my fair and honest feedback about it.  My review on this product was based on my experienced with it through testing it or using it after receiving it."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Well, I've been using it for quite sometime now and I honestly don't like it very much.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

Gave it 3 stars for Lenovo at least trying to improve a product but did not really do a good job."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.  But, I guess he's not hurtin'.  America eats this crap up."

I bought two of them. I needed a longer one (80') for the far other end of yard, but I used an outdoor extension cord I already had to get it to the length I needed. I bought a heavy-duty outdoor timer that has 2 outlets for these two extension cords, so both projectors go off at the same time. Make sure you buy a quality timer that keeps accurate timing.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I found this book both very confusing and sort of boring. And not only that, but it seemed to drag on endlessly. It took me until mid-way through the third chapter to even figure out that Juliet was a grieving widow, and why? And when she came home and found a naked man in her pool, she acted like she didn't even know who he was, and yet, he had been around for years while caring for her sick husband. I found that really, really odd. There was a lot of the inner thought process going on in both of their heads all through the book, and they weren't even complete thoughts, at that!

I have read books by this author before and enjoyed her humor and quirkiness, but not this time. I will continue to read her books in the future, though, because she normally does a fantastic job. IMO- I don't know why, but something just felt a bit off with this one."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I have an anxious dog.  His anxiety is not such that my Veterinarian has recommended ""serious"" drugs for management, but I do like to try out the over-the-counter offerings like this one with him.

The big downside of this nutraceutical is palatability... neither of my dogs liked the taste and would ""eat around it"" when it was in their food.  I could easily ""pill"" them with it, but that's a hassle and I don't think it's particularly helpful to force things on an already anxious dog.  They would not eat it even when it was combined with peanut butter or had cheese wrapped around.  They are, admittedly, kind of picky, but that made this product unsuitable for us.

The ingredients are
Active Ingredients (Per Tablet)
Chamomile - 150mg
Passionflower Powder - 100mg
GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) - 100mg
L-Theanine - 50mg
L-Tryptophan - 33mg
Thiamine (Mononitrate) - 4mg
Ginger Root Powder - 2.5mg
Inactive Ingredients Beef flavor, brewers yeast powder, liver powder, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, thiamine mononitrate.

These are interesting and not ones I have seen combined before.  Theoretically, the L-tryptophan and L-theanine, in particular, could have calming effects, although the research jury is still out on everything from dose to actual efficacy.  I do think this comes under the heading of ""mostly harmless,"" although you should always check with your Vet about anything with which you plan to attempt to treat your pet long term.

This is certainly affordable, compared to a few of the other popular over-the-counter remedies.  Be aware that it is very common for it to take 6 weeks or longer before you see effects from any nutraceutical.  Cautions on this product indicate that it hasn't been proven safe for pregnant or lactating bitches, and that it should be discontinued 5 days before any general anesthesia is administered."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon."

It's classy, comfortable, and shiny - and looks like it's going to stay that way.
It lives up to the 'comfort fit' label by being comfortable, sliding on easy and staying on.

Its not white gold or platinum but it looks just as nice and so is the price.
And at this price, you never have to worry about losing or breaking it.
This will likely be my daily wear ring. Buy it now while the price is right!

Update: May 7, 2015
The ring remains intact but it has been prone to scratches. I recommend removing the ring prior to doing any kind of work with it (dishes, gardening, woodshop, etc.) Otherwise it's still a nice ring for the price."

The only reason I ordered this is because I had to replace a pair of shoes that had been in great shape for years. They had no arch support at all, and were very thin and uncomfortable. I had to return them.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the color is very different than the picture. I am 5'4"" and the picture shows me a medium. The material is very light and silky, but the inside of the shoe is actually a little thin.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statements of facts introduced into this book are true.  Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.

Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.

Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.

As I was thawing out mentally from the vast empty ice floes of northern Greenland where the novel played out its last pages, I began to see a few areas in the plot where Hoeg was skating on pretty thin ice.  But while I was reading, they didn't show, and even after, they didn't matter much.  Smillas cold universe was amazingly real, whether it was true or not."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I was so excited to see this Toy back on the market. This adorable huggable breathing Golden Retriever Puppy was very popular back 6 or 7 years ago. It was a gift to me from my husband, but my little 3 year old Grand-daughter was fascinated with just
watching it lay there and breathe like a real sleeping puppy. She would just stand and watch it for hours. Over the years, she
has loved this little puppy named, ""Honey"". During all her visits over the years, it was one of her favorites. It finally stopped working,
and we could not fix it. My Grand-daughter said if I ever found another one, she would really love to have it for her own.
I found it here on Amazon. The exact one that she wanted.
I just gave this Puppy to her on her 10th birthday, and she is thrilled. She lost her real dog, so this sleeps on her bed with her
at night. It came in it's own adorable Puppy bed, with a brush, a tagged collar, and real adoption papers to fill out. She is thrilled.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Brash Books likes to revive old classics. Hit and Run was first published in 1989, so our heroine, Delilah, has to work this case the old fashioned waywithout the internet or even a cell phone. She doesnt actually witness the Trans Am mowing down the elderly man; she hears tires squealing and a thud while pulling herself up from where she landed when the car climbed the curb and she dove for safety. Then, she found the body of Joseph Collins in the street while limping to a telephone booth trying to figure out who to call for a ride. So when the teenage driver, Michael Moraless mother swears the old man was already lying dead in the street, and Mike did not realize hed even hit a human being, Delilah agrees to think about taking the case. And thats when things start to get really weird.

The janitor in Delilahs office building (where shes living, hoping business will pick up) is a would-be sleuth named Harry Polk who is thrilled to have a real PI in the place. Her self-appointed assistant, he gets beaten up by someone who doesnt want her to pursue her investigation. Charlie Colfax, a friend of her late husband, shows up frequently, offering her various jobs, trying to get her to close her office and work for him.

Hit and Run sucked me in on the first page and didn't spit me out until the end. I liked Delilah and the people around her. The only glitch I found was a tendency to use adjectives when Ms. OCallaghan should have used adverbs, a trend I see about as often as comma splices which were blessedly missing from this book. The characters were well drawn, and the dialogue was natural. Delilah West is the forerunner and role model for such female sleuths as V.I. Warshawski and Stephanie Plum, and she sets the bar pretty high. Grab Hit and Run while you can, and see how it all started."

What a lot of folks don't know is he is one of our generations greatest writers period taking genre out of the equation. I've never read a novel that jumps back and forth to two timelines that I've enjoyed...until now. King does it effortlessly and fluidly. Also the story itself is so absorbing I had a hard time putting this book down each night. Childhood and childhood fears are two things King does great with and this story is no exception. The young characters come to life instantly. Its easy to picture each one. With all that said, this is perhaps the scariest novel I've ever read. One novel comes to mind that trumps this one in the scare department and its not King. It was immensely spooky because it dealt with not only childhood fears, which we can all relate to, but an evil of magnitudal proportions.

It looks like a decor piece instead of pet fountain, which makes me feel less like a crazy cat lady. And Emily, my cat, has already approved it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope it will last a long time."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"If you have ever been to a bull riding event or just watched an event on the t.v. , you may of heard the name , Lane Frost . (I know that fans and basically anyone ever involved with the rodeo circuit know exactly who he is ). But you don't have to be a Bull rider or fan to enjoy this film . In my opinion-this film only lacks one thing - needed to delve a little deeper in his ability . (More than likely)-the film makers wanted to make this more of a love story (to appeal to a bigger audience) . Just seems that way ,because ,there was a lot more to Lane . -- So you pretty much don't have to know anything about the rodeo or bull riding . Just turn the lights down and snug up on the couch with your loved one (ones)-- and watch this film . It is very touching .

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,What can I say another word about the story?  I really enjoyed this story. The characters were so well developed and the story was well written.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I picked the ""Small"" size. For the review I chose ""Fits as expected"" but that's not EXACTLY true. The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable. Has ties to make it a bit smaller, a nice little hood that doesn't fall over my eyes, the fleece is super soft and comfortable and made me noticeable warmer in a cool room. Has on inside pocket on your left side. Very solid product especially for the price."

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

In case HiTec Pet reads these, your web site stinks.  The flashing graphic is so annoying.  Click on FAQ and it takes you to a fence FAQ.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Psychologist Daniel Hughes has done it again with his newest book, Attachment-Focused Parenting. In his highly-skilled and talented manner, Hughes has managed to take the complex terms and concepts of attachment theory and make it accessible for the reader. Hughes helps us to better appreciate that the parent-child relationship is a two-way interaction, with each being greatly influenced and affected by the other. Of equal importance, he helps the reader to see that parenting goes way beyond guidance and discipline; rather, both parent and child require a context for understanding what happens between them, and each is influenced by their own history.

Hughes relies extensively upon examples and real-life scenarios as he makes his points. In doing so, he appeals to a wide spectrum of parents. That is, he cites the example of a four-year-old who screams with frustration, while later addressing the parent-child struggles of a 16-year-old. Independent of age, however, the concepts Hughes lays out are universal for all children, regardless of age.

Get ready, though, as Hughes reminds us that the parent's own attachment history greatly affects the parent-child relationship. This certainly isn't new, as how often have we caught ourselves saying, ""I never thought I would say/do what my father/mother did..."" Without writing a self-help book for parents, Hughes proposes some questions and concepts parents should ask themselves about their own history, given the part it plays in raising their kids.

As a child psychologist who primarily works with foster and adopted children and their families, I continually deal with kids who have their own attachment issues to work through. While a professional can assist a child in this regard, much of the work to be done centers on the child's relationship with her parent, be it foster, adoptive, or birth. Because of this, Hughes' book will be at the top of my reference list for the parents I work with, but also for other professionals."

Footsteps stomped with the force of a giant on the wooden steps. Pounding in synchronization with each ragged inhale Nikki took.
Dang it. The door. Just as she lunged forward to lock it, the handle turned. She jumped back. This is probably nothing, just an innocent mix up in dates. But then again She lifted the spoon over her head.
A broad shoulder, covered in dark blue, entered her line of vision. Then a crop of longish, wavy hair. Just as the man angled his back to the door to close it
Womp! Not one to sport violent tendencies, she lowered the spoon with all the force of a pillow fight.
Owe! What the!
Startled blue eyes rounded on her. Apples and oranges skipped off the top of the brown paper sack and went flying across the floor. Shock, pain and aggravation crossed the mans features. His strong jaw clenched as if he fought against retaliation and she supposed, a string of cuss words.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is absolutely a brilliant,entertaining and challenging game,The price is reasonable and will stand up to years of use, either in a home or school-type environment
.However,care must be taken around small children who want to place things in their mouth,as several pieces are small enough to be swallowed. Also you have to be careful not to lose any of the pieces because any loss would render the game worthless. The quality of the game is excellent and the booklet of rules, puzzles and solutions is also excellent The booklet has a coil binding,so it can lie flat,the paper is very high quality as is the colored printing and it will withstand a lot of use. However the solution symbols are very tiny ,requiring lots of light and good eyesight or glasses.
 There are 60 puzzles ,grouped in 5 degrees of difficulty,Starter,Junior,Expert,,Master and Wizard.,each having 12 puzzles. The game resembles Rush Hour..but on Steroids. I would rate the difficulty level as 2,4,6,8 and  10 as the puzzles go from Starter to Wizard. For example the most difficult Starter puzzle,# 12 requires 26 moves to solve,the Expert puzzle # 36 requires 32 moves and the Wizard puzzle # 60 requires 123 moves to solve.
 So,there you go ,suitsable for all ages and puzzle solving skills.
Even younger ones will have fun playing with the game ,by ignoring the given puzzles and simply spilling out the pieces and trying to place them all in the tray,.
 I give this game 5* even though the packaging is not very good. First the package is about 3 or 4 times larger than it needs to be,the ""window"" should have had a heavy cellopane cover ( you can make one),and it should come with a cloth bag for storage or travel ( something else you can make.)

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.
 Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.
. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.
This is a great film for parents and grown children. I wish my mother was still alive- I'd love to take her to see it."

Also, I have had to use a second bag to store the bag for my dogs.  I put the bags on their coats and it took about 30 seconds for them to get used to it.  The bags are really nice and easy to put together.  I highly recommend it.

It's very sturdy and I love the adjustable compartments. Although I'm not using this for toys, it really works well for those of you who want a storage unit for beads, jewelry making supplies, etc. I can fit my tools, beads, cords and more. It's also great because I can fit enough of what I need in this unit and easily transport it if I want to make my jewelry in a different location and get out of my office! I highly recommend this to anyone who needs one unit to store lots of things with flexiblity to adjust the compartments. It's better than any of the containers I've purchased at craft stores and because it's made for kids, it's made to be strong! I purchased this at a discount for my fair and honest review.

Lamb created some interesting characters, and since this was the debut and introduction , it will be interesting to see where she goes with them . I found it interesting that meticulous research and experience ( Lamb's biography states that she had a career as a therapist) were mixed with some episodes where we were kind of forced to suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride . That's one of the reasons why as I write this review I don't know exactly how to classify it. It is kind of a cozy , a little bit of a procedural and also a work of creative license.

One of the more interesting depictions of the Joker in quite some time (in addition to Capullo's ""ripped off face Joker""), I like everything about this figure's look. Reminds me of a creepy, Prohibition era gangster type look, and it works well for a character who was created in the early 40's. Articulation is kind of limited, but what you would expect for a character in a suit - so not bad. My only complaint is the paint applications under his eyes. The creepy pinkish hue only goes under his eyes on mine - leaving the space directly under his menacing brows still white. I would have preferred that the pink go all the way up under his brows, but still a great looking figure!"

Hank Dalton received an ultimatum... Get married to inherit part of the family ranch... Or get left with nothing. Hank, the oldest, loved to run the ranch, but living two hours from civilization limits his choice of women. When his four brothers left for the city to pick up some girls, he chose to stay home... and got to rescue a stranded motorist... Charlotte Halton. Charlie was almost killed when her crazy BF drugged her and burned her apartment down, leaving her scarred both inside and out. She decided for a fresh start... and getting stranded in Paradise Valley in the middle of cattle country wasn't part of her plan... but it just may be Hank's luck. Hank knew it was fate that delivered a woman to him, but she's skittish. Can Hank help her find a new start? Or will she run away again?

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For much of my life, I have wanted to write a book and get it published.  Writing it was not a problem.  Publishing it was a problem, and when I read Steve's book, ""How to Discover Best-Selling Nonfiction eBook Ideas"", it had all the information I needed to get it done.  And it is done!  I am a published author.  And ... there are more books on the way!

 What I really liked about this book, and others by Steve Scott, is that not only does he give the answers to my questions, but he also gives a step-by-step tutorial on how to make it work.  Most books just give an answer, assuming that I will know what they mean and be able to figure it out for myself.  But Steve goes a step beyond that.

I can, without pause, give a STRONG recommendation to everyone who has a dream as I did, to write a book, read this first.  You'll be off on the right foot.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've been very pleased with these leggings. I'm 5'11"" and usually a L/XL size that says it will fit me, does not.  I was very impressed that these DID fit. They ended about 3 inches above my ankles, but could be pulled lower, resulting in a thinner, stretched legging.
 I was also impressed with how versatile the sizing can be for these because of the elastic waistband and stretchy fleece. These are true to the claim that they do not contain a seam.  The inside is a very soft, low pile fleece material. The outside is smoother, not furry.  The elastic waistband is incorporated INTO the fabric, so the waist is VERY comfortable and not bulky at all. These keep my legs warm in the winter and pair nicely with a boot.
I have noticed that when something rubs against them in the same place over and over, they can get little fuzz balls. They also attract animal hair like crazy. If you have pets you will probably become frustrated with this.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

What is behind the good for you/bad for you news on health?  What about alternative medicine and vitamins? How can I judge evidence for myself?  You can learn quite a bit from this slender volume.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also."

But others are hard to u dear stand what you are supposed to do, and the rewards/penalty could easily be written clearly but ey use images and it's a bit hard to follow.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I could sense the author's presence in this book of short stories; I almost felt as if she were reading them to me. I believe she is highly invested in her characters.

The stories, as indicated by the book's title, are grim, dealing with issues such as mortality, helplessness, identity and revenge. The story that resonated with me the most was The Promise, which partnered innocence with malignant intent. The resolution is tragic.

The stories are arranged in segments: Short, Shorter and Shortest. For me, the Shortest stories are presented more as ideas than as full tales, and need more content. However, the ideas are solid. I think that with a little time and polish, Alisha ""Priti"" Kirpalani will be a name to watch in the future."

No a supernatural being named ""Diesel"" has popped into her kitchen and is offering to help locate Sandy and get into the Christmas spirit. With a few days until Christmas, there is plenty of time to get into trouble, blow up a car or two and get into a tussle with elves, which is exactly what Stephanie does.

I do love the Stephanie Plum books. I read them years ago and I'm now re-reading them as audiobooks. Visions of Sugar Plums seemed like the perfect listen while I was doing all my holiday baking, and it was. It was certainly fun and over-the-top and what we expect from Janet Evanovich. I like that even though this is just a novella we saw all my favorites, well except for Ranger, and there were some hilarious moments with Grandma Mazur.

I've listened to quite a few of these books with the narration by Lorelai King and I like her voice. She's certainly become the voice of Stephanie, Lula and Grandma Mazur for me. Her voice for Diesel seemed a little slow to catch my interest, but by the end I enjoyed it as much as the others. I definitely plan to listen to the rest of the books in audio version."

Harding's advantage here is that he had a ringside seat as his colleagues at The Guardian were handed this opportunity.  They didn't blow the assignment.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it! If you like British humor, if you liked Pegg's other two movies, then you'll likely enjoy this film, as well. Very well written, interesting characters, nice approach to the mixed-genre subjects."

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass."

Used them for 3hrs first night, 2nd as well, then questioning how long they can run on 3 AAAs I just left them on all night, still lit in the morning & then every night through the outage & only once did I change the batteries, and those were cheapo sunbeam dollar store AAAs at that...

Kate was smart, honest and down to earth, something I don't usually find in female characters. I loved Brody! He came across as quite vulnerable which I like in a male character. It made a change to see a male character like that. These two characters are great on their own but together they really smoulder. They show a united front and both speak their mind. The love scenes weren't particularly steamy, I prefer a bit more detail but I don't think that would have suited this book. The plot was good and very well written.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Eliza (Ellie) Prentice and Thaddeus Sanborn are two damaged souls that have been running for far too long from their pasts, and from each other. A twist of fate brings them together again under life and death circumstances. Can they find the strength together to survive and the courage within themselves to be honest with each other.

An Inescapable Attraction is an engaging western romance that is set in the time period following the Civil War, but before the turn of the century. Through her descriptive writing, Sydney Jane Baily has done a superb job of bringing each character, and their surroundings to life. Her characters are not perfect, and there are moments that they are not even very likable. However, through all of Ellie and Thaddeus' trials and tribulations, both not only mature, but they each work out their differences and come to loving trust that will insure their HEA.

I found the cast likeable, and the alternating timeline helped to build suspense around what's really happening at the University. The book ends in a way that indicates it's the start of a series, but the main story in this book has a satisfying conclusion and gives you enough answers to things that you're not left hanging about everything.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended."

It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"**received a copy from author exchange for honest review**

Okay in one word is WOW. This is the first I have read from Mary Smith and have to say this is not your usual sports romance book. What got me about this book that made it so easy to love was its characters. I loved that you have a person like Meadow who seems like she is at the top of the romance world she is just like all of us waiting for her Prince Charming. The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there was so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what makes its characters so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model was genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio was hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear. Mary Smith just wowed me since this is the first I have read from will definitely keep up with her work. Get this book you won`t be disappointed from the camaraderie between its characters, the love between Meadow and Kyson even his teammaters were awesome. Can`t wait for Book 2 in this series."

The only problem is that it has a little bit of a smell, but I'm sure letting it air out will help. You could always use febreeze or perfume to make it smell better. Not a deal breaker.

Only recommend this product if you're going to lay it flat on the floor. If you're trying to stick to a wall, forget about it. It WILL not stay.

Very solid and well-made product. Took some getting used to stuffing speaker cable inside. I used the entire length and didn't need to cut into. Worked out very nicely after all was said and done. The double-side tape took a minute to get the backing off, but once I did, it was SUPER STRONG. Hopefully, it stays stuck to my tile flooring and I never have to worry about unsightly cables again. Much thicker than I had anticipated."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I absolutely loved the second book in this series Plush 2 was phenomenal K.B. Winters has done an amazing job in writing this series so far.

The second book picks up exactly where the first leaves off Allison is going through a rough time now that she has lost her job and she believes that Cooper was behind it all along. This book you will really find that you will have a love hate relationship with Cooper while he is absolutely charming and sweeps Allison off of her feet at times he also acts like a complete and total jerk during others, so in other words a complete and total alpha male (sinfully delicious yes please!). This book leaves you will a lot of questions at the end like whether or not this is going to work out for Allison and Cooper. Will he be able to change his ways? Will Allison finally be able to catch a break?

K.B. Winters did such a fantastic job writing this book it was full of drama, suspense, action and some hot and steamy sex scenes the chemistry between Allison and Cooper in this book is so great it just grabs you and makes you feel like you are right there along for the ride with them. She does such a great job of bringing the reader along and making them feel like they are a part of they story.

Fantastic job! I cannot wait to see what the final book reveals!"

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.

Books_5,5.0,CG,"In 2006, Grigory Perelman proved that an academic with a PhD in history could make a difference in the lives of two people. The book, ""A History of the United States"", is a great book. It covers the history of the United States from the American Revolution to the present day. In the book, Perelman provides us with a list of the major events that shaped the nation. He discusses the role of the American Revolution and the role of the white slave trade in the growth of the country. He also discusses the history of the American Revolution and the role of the slave trade in the development of American capitalism. As a historian, I can only recommend this book to those interested in history and the politics of the time. It is a great book to read for anyone interested in the history of the United States. This is a great book. It is a good read, but not one that is easy to read. It is very hard to follow, but it is a very informative and informative book. The story is very well written.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book addresses many areas of struggle when raising a boy. It describes why boys and girls require different approaches to parenting and how to address those differences. I like that every chapter is divided into different issues: a chapter on communicating with boys, talking about sex, and emotions. It even gives examples of effective disciplining techniques to use with your boys. I especially like that there is a chapter on boys and their mothers and another chapter on boys and fathers. Each role model plays a different, yet important role in their son's life and this book addresses that nicely."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try."

In the beginning his father Neill hates the idea an does everything he can to not pass on the Cheifton to him. He seems to hate Ailig and it becomes clear why. The story held my interest. It just doesn't have much romance going on an very little sex nothing even worth mentioning. Bk. 1 and 2 just lacks that hot sexy romance story I like in the H/H.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Anna Pigeon is a jack of all trades. Not only is she a park ranger with law enforcement training, but she's also an emergency medical technician and a trained firefighter. One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees, but quibbles aside, this is a superb book. Barr uses the drama of a fire to isolate her cast of characters in classic locked-room mystery fashion, then cuts them off from the outside world while Anna races against time to figure out who she can trust before she becomes the next victim. If there's a flaw it lies in the fact that a vital clue is a bit too obvious. I can't say more without giving away too much, but people who've read lots of mysteries will probably figure out part of what's going on simply from the way the story is constructed. Firestorm, however, is really a story of fire, firefighters, and the southern Cascades in the vicinity of Mt. Lassen National Park, and minor imperfections in the mystery barely detract from it at all. Highly recommended."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review. I purchased the blue, and found it to be a lovely and soothing hue very much like the one pictured. I'm glad I tried it,  and I like it!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!
I'll keep buying these."

I just went with the XL and it's just a bit loose.  I would not recommend these for any other purpose.These are great.  I love the fit.  They are a little too tight, but not too tight.  The only negative thing is that the fabric is a little thick.  I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and they are a little short in the torso, so I'm going to keep them for a short while.  I'm still wearing them, but not as much as the reviews suggest.  I like them a lot, but they are a little long on the torso, so I might have to order another pair.  I'm going to wear them with a navy shirt underneath, because I'm very picky about the colors.  I will also be wearing them with jeans, but not on maternity wear.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I was so excited when I saw that this eARC had dropped on to my Kindle.

From the first page, I was drawn in to the world of Keely & Ronan and just from the prologue I was like ""dammmnnnn this is gonna be good""

I read this book in a few hours, non stop. Whilst I really enjoyed aspects of it, I also felt like something was lacking to give it that X Factor ya know?

I was intrigued to find out what happened for Ronan to leave all them years ago, however when it finally came out I was like hmm okay then.

Also, 60% before we get some bow chicka wow wow, and even that was just a finger bang! Still had to wait a wee while for some full on loving ;)

I freaking loved Ronan with Emma, right from the get go - so freaking swoonworthy!! and the Epilogue part - gah perfection!!

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"40 Guns to Apache Pass was a Columbia Pictures production. This review is of how Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has ignored our greatest war hero and not of the poor quality of this offering. This release is not one of Columbia Pictures/SPHE's. Our greatest war hero's memory deserves better treatment. I will purchase this DVD when Sony remasters it for DVD release. Even better, Sony should remaster Audie Murphy's remaining movies not yet released on DVD onto a series of Blu-Ray collections befitting a man of his stature. Randolph Scott deserves the same multiple Blu-Ray collections of his many westerns he starred in. C'mon Sony, start mining those golden nuggets in your vaults, polish them up (remaster) and release them in standard DVD and Blu-Ray to protect them for posterity and to give us western movie collectors something worth buying. I buy 20 western DVDs and Blu-Rays to 1 modern movie today because they knew good story telling back in the day and morals of right and wrong were reinforced with their telling. Today, we have many people wondering through life without a moral compass. But, I digress. Please give Audie and Randolph the respect they deserve and do it right! You have gold mines in your vaults if you'd only realize it and treat their fans and these stars of long ago the way they should be treated. I have written to SPHE already. I hope others will too."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,"When I was younger, I saw this and thought it was pretty cool. My 2 year old has a lot of fun with it. The only negative is the plastic is a bit loose and that's a good thing. It's a little hard to balance it with the other two toys. I think it's a good toy to keep them engaged and to have on hand for play.I bought this for my son to use as a teaching toy.  He likes it, and so does my son.  He is now learning about the alphabet, letters, and numbers, and is enjoying playing with it.  It is easy enough for him to grasp and put together, but hard for him to put down and take it out of the box.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the show.  My son is almost 3 and loves to play with it.  It is very well made and really fun.  I would recommend this to anyone with a child who loves teaching letters and numbers.This is a great way to teach kids to be creative and creative.  I have had this for a long time and I still use it as a classroom tool.  It's not a ton of batteries but it is nice to have a little extra charge.  I bought a small plastic battery pack for my daughter and it's been a great deal!"
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I initially had high hopes for this product.  I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that has built in Hauppauge tuners (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model).  I was thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cables to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network.  It worked pretty well for about 10 months.

The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months.  The cooling fan stopped working and it was so hot to the touch, it was making my closet smell like burnt electronics.  I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.)  And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping.  Yawn.  I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one.

The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area.

On the other hand the Hauppauge tuners have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years.  As a bonus, the Hauppauge also acts as my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes.  As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner has the worst signal, the single has slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best.  So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there.  But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 years is a large upside.

Bottom line, I will not purchase or consider this unit again."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This thing is amazing.  I own this type and the one with the handle.  I use it while starting up the fire pit for my little girl to cook smores.  I've used it in wind, drizzle, and snow...with the right tinder and technique, you'll have fire in no time.  I have these in my Bug-Out-Bag, my saddle bag, and on my knife.  Every custom knife sheath maker that I have encountered can put a holder on your sheath, kydex or leather. It's very simple to use...cost as much as a cheap zippo and is more reliable!  The 3/8"" steel is perfect for me...it shows a little wear and I don't doubt that it will last 1,000's of strikes as it is advertised.  With good technique, which you can acquire by watching youtube, and a 5-10 minute practice to...well...practice and get the coating off, you can get good technique and start fires with only a few strikes (at most).

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I also purchased the LU79 which I used to crosscut thin veneered Chinese Birch and it was quiet, smooth, fast, and the cut was perfect, no tares or splinters; I could have used it all day. It takes me a little time to change blades but it is worth the time to make great cuts in this plywood. It is only 1/2 inch thick but tares easily and is thin on top and very smooth. This wood can look bad with the wrong blade so I am read glad I got this 80t thin kerf blade. This is the 3rd Freud blade I have now and they cost more but your projects will have a great finished look you can be proud of."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"For the price, these treat boxes are excellent.  The 6"" tall measurement is from the base to the top of the handles when they are assembled.  In terms of storage space, the interior dimensions once assembled can accommodate items about 6"" long, 3"" wide, and 3-4"" tall.  Like most cheap mass-produced paper goods, there are some small defects on some individual pieces (some cuts aren't clean, some stick together, etc.),  If you are a perfectionist who will be bothered by these slight defects, you should consider ordering a 10% overrun.  Mine were going to kids, so I didn't care.  I would not use these for heavy items, but they were great for kids party favors."

It looks nice and quality is good (I hope it will stay this way after washing it).  It has an error in the material on the side of the print. It is not that visible, but it is there. I also thought it will be a little bit lighter color, but I still like it. I think for the price this is really a good pillow case,worth my few spend bucks."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"My cat needed lysine - but she didn't like it in any form (capsule mixed into her food, gel, chew).  This one was the best - she will eat it sometimes, if I break it into 2-3 pieces, unlike the vet's chews, which cost a good deal more and were completely rejected.  This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much)."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

I wish I could give these sandals more than 5 stars. They're perfect. I am a very, very satisfied customer!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"If you're looking for a solid, sturdy, high profile, dovetail scope mount, this is it. Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.

The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.

It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.

Solid construction. Definitely would recommend."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for a honest review.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sports romances!"

Just mentioned it so if you're not in a hurry, save a few bucks and buy it from their site-with free shipping. Used this on my HF drill press that uses candelabra base to convert to E27 LED bulbs.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,I use these at the shooting range and they're just OK. They don't seem to be 29 reduction but I don't know that I can tell that much difference. I like that they fold and they seem to hold up well but they are not as effective as others I have used. I often use foam earplugs instead because those don't interrupt my sighting on my stock.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Why do I love this show?

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

DISCLAIMER: Though the writers are good at what they do, don't listen to any of their commentaries.  They are exceptionally boring, lackluster, and have slightly soured my enjoyment of the show.  It's that bad."

I thought my old vacuum was great but I did a pass with that then I did a pass with the Hoover and was grossed out!!! I could not believe all the additional cat/dog hair that it pulled out of the carpet. My back is not so great but this is easy to handle. This is my first bagless system and I really thought I would hate it but it empties out very easy & goes right back on the system with no problem. I only wish the hose was a bit more flexible but I believe over time it will become more stretchable.

I have worn these quite a few times since I got them a week ago. I love these shoes. Hope to buy some in another color. Thanks KEDS!!  This one is wonderful!! I wrote no on arch support. because it only has a small arch support in them, (the same as is in the classic style)  but if you are looking for a shoe that has lots of arch support you probably need to get orthopedic inserts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have used electric pressure cookers in the past and each one has died within the first year of use when the electronics simply went haywire.  I've wanted to try a stove top model but was hesitant remembering the behemoth my mother used to use.

As soon as I saw the Clipso by T-fal, I knew that it would be the model that I would get the most use out of.  It is large enough for my needs without being too large.  The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand."

I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"The biggest problem I had with this is that it was written in first person present tense. I hated that from the first sentence to the last. I couldn't stop thinking about the scene in the movie The Emperor's New Groove where the guy gets mocked for humming his own theme music. This book seemed to be humming its own theme music by Carmella telling me herself every movement she made as she does it. ""I stumble through my apartment door"". ""I navigate the seven paces to my galley kitchen. "" I take a huge bite. "" It all felt unnatural. So the book lost a star in my rating just for that alone.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.

With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door,  it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.

The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parents

I served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.

The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook."

My main annoyance is that the outside is showing wear after only a month.  It has scratches form spots I can not explain.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.  My PC is getting ""older"" and I feel it gets hotter than it should at times, but this is a great remedy.  The hollow core keeps it cooler and safer.  When not in use, I store it easily on my bookshelf, and it takes no room."

This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.

I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.

Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked. I probably would continue this series because I found myself liking some of the secondary characters (who's book is next in the series) slightly more than I liked Keelin and her beau."

4/5 because the glass edge was very slightly chipped on one small section, but not enough to warrant a return. Also, the outer shipping box was not the best in the world...soaked and crushed by FedEx. Thankfully, the canopy itself was unharmed.

The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

The price of these shoes was outstanding!"

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"While no cat litter is fantastic at least this is organic and does not contain Silica. Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Thunderbolt transfers are ridiculously fast compared to Firewire and USB -- 10 gbps -- and are incredibly handy when working on the fly with large files. It's an excellent choice for large video, photo, and audio files. It can be daisychained, too, so you can have multiple adapters setup for one machine (ultimate efficiency and speed!).

Unfortunately, no cable is included - so this can become an expensive upgrade pretty quickly.  I used this in conjunction with a 3TB Seagate drive, and was very pleased at its utility for backing up and storing files; Thunderbolt's speed is definitely overkill for regular small backups, but is invaluable with huge files and directories. It doesn't require a Seagate hard drive, just any SATA III drive."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars."

I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I recently returned  a Porter-Cable 9866 cordless drill because the chuck was annoyingly bad. The P-C would not hold a screwdriver bit and scored the shanks of several of my round shank bits.
I replaced it with the DeWalt 983 and there is no comparison. The additonal few dollars are well worth it. I did jobs identical with those I attempted with the Porter-Cable and had no problems. These jobs included drilling in stainless steel and even as the bit broke through the work the DeWalt did not stall and the chuck held the number 3 bit flawlessly.
I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting. I guess this makes sense as I don't need much torque when driving screws and the high speed setting easily drives #14 screws. I own several Porter-Cable tools and they are all excellent.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is the  fourth story about Charlie Harris and his cat Diesel. The characters seem real, as their considerations and doings are quite slow and not jumping to conclusions although for once I wanted the story to be longer. You can't wait to see how his family develops and evolves, but most of all it's the language, the tone of the writing which makes it an easy and pleasant to read. Can't wait to read the next, but I hope Diesel is the one to go exploring, perhaps even secretly run away and get a cat girlfriend, as well as become more involved with solving the actual murder. You just LOVE Diesel, he's really the reason for reading the story. And he's just doing regular cat stuff, but he seems SO real.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Author Paul Theroux spent several months traveling through the great Middle Kingdom (China) by train in 1986, as that nation's economic surge was underway and change was starting to affect the land.  He details what he found and observed, making a host of political and social observations.  He notes that this communist nation was rapidly becoming capitalist (but remaining a police state) under the market reforms of Deng XiaoPing, and the relief many ordinary Chinese felt that the Mao years and Cultural Revolution were gone.  He also looks at the rising prosperity, a factor that has surprised more than a few western visitors.  Yet reading this book after my own (much shorter) trip to China a decade later, I found his writing style rather stiff, and his adventure not all that adventurist  It does have some interesting if somewhat dated mid-1980's observations of China, a nation that has changed significantly over the past quarter century."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am obsessed with mason jars. As someone that cans, I always have mason jars on hand. I use them for everything possible. I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

I received this product for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review. This is my unbiased, honest opinion of this product."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"We have three generations living in our home so we have the young men trying to gain muscle weight and mature folks aiming to lose a few pounds.  We all agreed we needed a kitchen scale so we could accurately track what we were eating.  So, you can imagine how pleased I was when I received an offer to review this item with no cost.  When it arrived I was so excited.  It looks very sleek, modern and yet classic so it would fit right in with any kitchen decor.  Once, the rest of the family saw it everyone wanted to measure 'stuff' to see how it worked.  Besides the refrigerator it is now our most used appliance in our kitchen.  My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons. This scale makes it a breeze to make any recipe.  I highly recommend you try this scale out, we have had it for nearly a month and just love it!"

I don't I know how hard it will be to return or exchange it, but due to 2 of 3 usb ports being dead,  its not much better than any cheap old power stripI have laying around.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I have not yet shot with this scope, NOT YET MOUNTED.  1)  It took over 4 weeks to receive it from time of ordering.  2)  The whole scope was covered with dust.  3)  The objective lens had smear marks on it but cleaned with a microfiber cloth alright.  4)  When I took the lens caps off after the 4 day return policy had expired, much to my surprise I discovered that the objective lens tube AT THE END was FLAT for about 2 inches instead of round.  The tube is NOT flat anywhere at the objective lens itself, but at the end of the scope.  That is more than a drop - that is someone sending me a scope from China that was mis-manufactured and hoping I'd never take the lens cover off I guess.  Since I'm stuck with the flawed product, I will still try shooting long range with it and report more later."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,I am giving it 4 Stars for Now. I have not used it yet. That being said.

People who do not know how to use one. unskilled home owner. can ruin the BEST most EXPENSIVE tool on the Market. When cutting. push the Saw all the way down on the FOOT and apply adequate pressure to keep it there as sawing. do not FORCE the SAW too hard to make the cut. Watch out for BLADE BINDING by the Material you are cutting starts pinching the blade. you can burn the Motors out by too much MUSCLE forcing it down thru the cut. or binding the blade!.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Caroline Andrews and Josh Summers were the match that I was looking for in this series. They had different reasons for needing a second shot. Love was not the only reason to need a second chance at something important. Their encountered began with the previous books of the series. Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing blades for a child. This product is very well made, and the blades are very well made. My son loves it!

It would be nice if this dollhouse had some plastic parts that could be removed. The other items I have purchased are for the wooden pieces. The pieces are very easy to break, and the furniture is very easy to set up and put on. It's not a toy that is easy for a 4 year old to play with.

Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My ferret loves this Vitamin Supplement! I love this product and have purchased it for almost 5 years and will continue to purchase it for the well-being of my girl.  I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.

This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.

What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.

I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this card as a last resort attempt to cure my wireless connection. We have a 2 family house with access points on the 1st and 2nd floor, it is not an overly large house but try as I might I could not get a consistent signal in parts of the house with the built in LAN card on my Gateway laptop. I moved the routers, tried different antennas, downloaded updated drivers, even bought a new router for downstairs, but would only get 1 or 2 bars in the living room, with multiple drops. As a last resort I thought, why not disable the on board wireless and try a wireless card?

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

All I can say is, it works great. No drops, strong signal even outside. For me this was a great purchase. On my Vista laptop I did not have to install any software it used the Windows software and was a turnkey fix."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"The Mega Fun 93628 Marble Fun Run has been a delight for my children to play with. This set has allowed them open ended play to build and discover for hours at a time. It's been fun watching them work and seeing them try to speed up or slow down their marbles to get to the bottom first. It's a good set to enhance problem solving skills, spatial reasoning, and so much more!

The set comes with 105 pieces and this includes 30 marbles. There are instructions to build the run on box, if so desired. The variety of pieces vary from curvy, straight, a loop de loop, starter areas with little levers, pieces that have detachable and re-attachable wheels, and more! Some of the pieces are translucent with sparkle and the rest are solid colors. The variety of colors this set is made up of makes it gender neutral. My son and daughter ages 7 and 4 years old have played with this set on their own as well as together.

This set is well made and the pieces stay together once hooked up together. I would suggest parents to put the little levers and tabs in the pieces they are meant for. My son tried to do this on his own and ended up breaking one of the pieces. With that being said, he tends to be a little rough on things. Other than that small mishap we've had no issues of the set showing wear or breaking easily.

I would certainly recommend this set. It's great for down-time during the afternoons or on days when the weather just too hot or rainy to enjoy outside. One thing I like is that more sets can be purchased to make an even bigger marble run! My kids said that they love playing with it and I am glad they do too! *I received a sample of this product for review purposes *"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"So, I've never read any of Dimon's work, but the blurb had me SUPER interested to see what would happen. I have to say I was NOT let down in the slightest. Although this book was slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapters to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eyes bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

I just don't think this was well-written, and I don't mean the translation.  I mean the narrative.  Fiction 101 tells a writer to SHOW, NOT TELL.  Instead of making there be anything vivid, let alone convincing, about these people or the pathos of the situation, Larsson tells tells tells.

This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

Not to mention all the sand and dirt and crap that goes with that. And it still works.

I think it's just a good size for a one-year-old to play with. I think it's great for a toddler who has a lot of toys and is a little rough with it. I would recommend it to anyone who is an adult.

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.

While the whole ""NOOOO!"" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)

Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.  Why ruin a good thing?

""This deal has been altered once.  Pray I don't alter it any further!""

I was looking for something that I could ride on, but I just didn't like the size.  The fact that it had a small wheel makes it very hard to ride, which is nice for a child.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Boggle is a great word game that is fun for the whole family in which players have three minutes to find as many connected words as they can in a 4x4 grid.  It doesn't take long to play (only three minutes to be exact) and you don't need a lot of space to play it.  It uses a lot of the same skills as scrabble, but unlike in scrabble you won't keep getting beaten every time by that brainy uncle who must have memorized the dictionary, because most of the words that can be found are only 3 or 4 letters long, and even younger kids have a fair chance to win(occasionally a very long word can be found however - my personal triumph was the 8-letter ""nicotine"").  Also, you WILL learn new words you never knew existed from this game when people guess them and make you look them up - crazy words like ""hie"" and ""tat"" and ""coe"".  Overall a very fun game well worth buying, although I wish they still made the bigger version, because that one's a lot of fun too."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Update: July 11, 2014
I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again."

She is a cat with a very hard time in the cage, so it was a good idea to find something that would keep her occupied longer. I will keep buying the plastic ones and having them for her. She will probably just be a little bit more used to them. I love this brand of cat food. I have tried other brands before, but this one is the best for my little ones. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and it has stopped my little one from getting sick from all the other brand's."

But I was on the fence about buying this because I was worried about the durability of the case and the sound quality of the device. This case is very sturdy, it is made of sturdy material, and it is very well built. The only thing that I would like is that the case fits into the top of the Kindle. The Kindle cover on this case does not fit. It is very difficult to put it in and out of the case."

The material is very absorbent, which makes it very easy to clean.  The material is also a bit soft for a dog that has sensitive skin.  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it is still a nice size for my dog.  It's very easy to wash, and I would recommend it to others.  I will definitely be buying this bed again.I ordered this product and am happy with it. It is a nice size for my Maltese and I like that it is made in the USA. I can't say enough about it. I had a baby dog with a severe heart attack and she was having trouble getting up. This product is wonderful and helps her get up and down. It is very durable and I like that it has a removable lid to keep her from being stuck in the car.

It is also very durable and seems to be able to withstand some more daily wear and tear. The size fits my 18 lb pitbull with a small chest and a large head. I am very pleased with this purchase.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Comprehensive look at the immediate future for human employment as computers take over.  Uses his experience with computer chess programs to obtain some insights into human-computer combinations for the future.  For example, humans+computers beat humans alone easily and also beat computers alone.  Also, note that existence of computers smarter than humans (in chess) does not stop popularity of watching human vs human playing, or of matches of human+computer vs human+computer -- but no one wants to watch computer vs computer for very long (p. 156)!  My analogy:  we don't watch locomotives race either.  Also, p. 99, suggests that understanding how current chess programs work gives good clues to ways computers ""think,"" and how that is (will be) different from us.

Some Notes and Quotes:

(p. 8) ""If you and your skills are a complement to the computer, your prospects are likely to be cheery.""

(p. 8) Likely best future for us is commercial coalition Canada-US-Mexico.

(p. 46) Fig. shows civilian labor force available as fraction of total adults (?) went from 55%  1950-1970 to 65% from 1980-2010.  He seems to make a big deal of this, I don't see it.  Women went to work after  the baby boomers left home, so?

(p. 61) increasing number of American workers turning to self employment partly due to high unemployment.

 (p. 136) Re: worries about machines taking over production: ""If just about everyone has a stake in the machines, this could be a utopia.""  In other words, buy stock in companies going to full automation. Or, government tax on machines, as someone else suggested.

Has good discussion of what Turing originally meant by his ""test"" (not what you think).

Chap. 9.  Argues outsourcing and immigration are not cause of American unemployment; actually, we do better when we allow more immigration.

(p. 167) Surprising statistic:  imports from China only 2.7% of consumer spending!

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Let us, gentle reader, ignore this films failure as a sci-fi / religious movie and let us celebrate its triumph as the greatest comedy of all time.
Imagine, for a moment that Jerry Falwel decides to make a film based the book of Job. Jerry casts himself as Job (in KISS make-up) then casts Adam West as the voice of God and the Olsen Twins as Satan. Add a soundtrack by The Bloodhound Gang featuring Cher and you begin to get a small idea of the unintentional hilarity that is Battlefield Earth.
I had a few friends over to watch this and we had a blast (the alcohol helped...alot). Our favorite part was when former Sweat Hog John Travolta as the platform-boot wearing Terl hands over a machine gun to the hero (and I'm using that word in its broadest possible sense) Johnnie. Johnnie hands the gun BACK to Terl and then spends the rest of the movie trying to get his hands on MORE guns. ""Whattcha gonna do with those"", we screamed at the TV ""hand 'em over?""

The ice bowl is made of a heavy plastic and is great. The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl or any flaws that I could see. I was a little worried that it would leak but it does not and works very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled.
The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part.
So not only is this a great functioning product, but this works very well and looks elegant! I have had many compliments on this serving dish and I have referred many people to this bowl, I am over all satisfied with this product and this is just great and I couldn't be happier with this product.

The handles of the pliers, after about 3 weeks of light use, began to flop around which made this tool useless. The joints where the pliers and the handles join is crucial to the performance of this tool. There is no way to take this tool apart and repair those joints. So if it fails, the tool is garbage."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I received all five books very quickly but my problem is with the books themselves, not the sellers. All five books have the smallest print I have ever seen in a book. Even with reading glasses they are very difficult to read. Just ordered a magnifier to see if that helps. I can't imagine why they would use such small print in any book."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Here it all is in plain sight--the prescription for the endless wars and police states of the twentieth century.  It's hard to say whether the Torah, the Talmud, or the Communist Manifesto have been more influential on the lives of the proletarian drones urged to march to battle and destroy each other for a series of overlapping, frequently contradictory reasons.  If you google ""high arka conductors and artists"" you'll see part of a suitable satire on the subject."

However I always read the comments and many said that this North Face Jacket ran small. Well it does not, for me anyway. Wish I had ordered the Small.

I was quite surprised to see that the author had written a new one that I didn't even know about.  I enjoyed the book, but I felt the author had gotten bogged down in a series of events and characters.  I do hope that the author can do a better job of writing a sequel to this book.  The author does an excellent job with the story and characters.  I was looking forward to reading the next book in the series, but now that I have read this one, I can't wait"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that."

I like that the bread is thick and it holds a lot of flour, so it's easy to make for our dinner guests.  We also used it to make a pasta dish for two people.  This is a very handy feature.  I like that it's a small and easy to carry to the counter to store for later use.  I also like that the bag holds a lot of flour so you don't have to worry about it spilling out the bag.  I also like that it doesn't come with a lid.  It's a little awkward to use but it works great for our needs.

The collar is made well and the color is great.  My dogs love to chew on the collar and they seem to like it too.  The material is very soft and my dog is very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this collar to any dog owner.This is a great product!  We have a great dog who is on a gluten free diet and this helps her to get her teeth cleaned and remove plaque from her mouth.  I was able to find this on Amazon for $30.  My vet said it was the best on the market and I was really impressed.  I used this product on a very small dog and she has been getting very good results.  She is a big chewer so it is important to keep her food on hand, which is important to me as she is a chewer.  I would definitely recommend this product!I was worried about the quality of this bed but it is great! I have a two year old cat who had this bed on the floor for about 2 months.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I was visiting a friend who had one of these for her kids.  My youngest at the time was fascinated by this.  I don't know why.  I mean, I don't think it's weird or anything, in fact far from it.  But there is just something about it that kept my kid's attention for a long time.  He was all over using the drill to put the bolts into the board, then unscrew them, then back and forth again.  It is the darndest thing.

So it looks overly simple, and to my adult eyes I can't help but wonder what the big deal is.  But I'm not a four year old, and said four year old was enamored with it.

Of course we had to get one of our own.  The biggest challenge is keeping all the parts together - screws get lost and all of that, but it's still fascinating for that kid.  It's a great toy."

Thought that does not mean she  is hateful and mean.  She is a good character that I would like to learn more about.  Secondary characters could use more background and development, though they are  not shallow caricatures, or too heavy handed stereotypes.  I will be getting the second book."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper."

In addition, I'm taking a sightseeing trip this summer and will be on my feet at least 12 hours a day.  These boots completely fit the bill.

They are attractive enough that they look great with jeans or khakis.  They look especially cute with white socks and walking shorts.  They are not too clunky, they look like brown sneakers/shoes.  They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period was required.  I stomped through the mud and water and my socks stayed nice and dry.  I worked outside for a good 12 hours, the first time I put them on, and when I got in the house, I felt good, my back, knees and feet felt just fine, all of which I have trouble with.  They are true to size.  I will replace them with another pair when they wear out.  Money well spent.  I recommend them highly.  I'll buy another pair if I find them in black.

Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.

BUT
- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!  Ka Boom!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Worth every penny.  This product will pay for it's self many times over.  Just the cost of going to the range, ammo and time.  Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.  When I do go to the range I expect to see big improvements and be able to stay in shape when I don't have time to shoot live.  Well worth the price for the convenience and realistic feel."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I am really impressed with the Skyfi3 XM Satellite Radio.  It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.  These can then be sorted by various means to access the recordings.  The device has many functions and for the $26.99 including S&H for the car kit it was well worth it.

I do think it's a stretch to say this is for 8 years and up, though. I think an 8-year-old or older child would feel this is too babyish for them. But I think a younger child in the age range from 5 to 7 might be a better target."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.

There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.

The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.

There is a real romance in there!  I did warm up towards Wulfgar. The characters did seem more believable and sympathetic towards the middle of the story. Towards the late middle to the end I could not put it down."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"As a stand-alone book, The Long Earth takes its time getting started, which may put off Pratchett's usual audience. The thing is, it's not a stand-alone. It's the first half of a 2-part series, which may explain they very many apparently random events and characters and why the ending feels so odd: it's not really the end.

The Long Earth is equal parts SF and real (and very hardcore) science, with a huge number of callbacks to Sir Pterry's Science of Discworld books. Pratchett and Baxter's world-building is outstanding, believable, and meticulous. Well, aside from the steampunk airship. The humour is far more subtle than most of Pratchett's other work; more like Nation than the Discworld novels.

Like Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, The Long Earth has a vaguely hallucinatory feel. This may be intentional, or a symptom of the Embuggerance. For all that, it's a relatively quick and easy read. If you're unsure about buying it, you may want to borrow a copy from a friend."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Needed to add this size to my other Cuisinart cookware and love it.  Very good quality and cooks quickly and evenly.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I highly recommend this case. Especially if you use your phone for things like watching video, reading documents and such.
The case is very protective at the corners which is where a phone gets most damage.
The two features i love are the standing slot and the auto on. Whenever you open the case the screen automatically turns on. This feature doesnt waste any battery and it saves you if your power button is losing. you don't even have to latch it everytime, I only latch it when i put it in my pocket. Normally i just let the cover down until the latch is resting on the edge and it shuts the screen off.
The inside is very soft and won't scratch the screen and the outside feels great.
Nothing i can find wrong with it except i wish it covered the edges of the phone more like it does the corners."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"First off I want to thank the author for writing this book.  This is the first book in a series and the first I have read by this author.  I was very impressed with the writing style and the characters.  I was also very impressed with the story line.  I love a good mystery with a good twist.  I have never read a book that has such a good ending.  I felt like I was right there with the main character.  I'm not going to say too much because the ending is too abrupt, but I feel like the author did a great job of giving the book a great ending.  I read the first two books in the series and I loved this one.  The author does an excellent job with the story and the characters.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"I purchased a system from Lorex and when I opened the box, it was missing parts, so Lorex said that I had to purchase $50 worth of parts (power cord, remote control & mouse) to make it work. Yes... those items should have been in the box (as stated on the box). After buying the parts and plugging it into an outlet, it did not work. Lorex does not want to replace or refund it. I have been fighting with Lorex for over a year about this. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a system that I installed and had working in just a few minutes. Save your time & money, go to Wal-Mart and get a different system (not made by Lorex). I wish that someone would have warned me about Lorex and they way they treat customers.

Also, if you have a problem with Lorex products, you are told to submit a (claim) ticket on-line. After they can't or better yet ""won't"" help, they cancel your ticket and if you want to continue to fight them, you have to submit another ticket.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"As I sit here, writing this review, I am really tired because the book kept me up until 3:15 AM. I just could not go to bed without finishing it!
Iles writes a great thriller (this is the second of his that I have read) and I am glad there are several more of his yet to be read. He kept me guessing right up until the killer was revealed ---I usually am able to guess ""who done it"" much sooner in a book. I like books with art as a part of them, and this was very well done, giving readers a good glimpse into the mind of artists and the dog-eat-dog world of collecting art. I thought that the twists and turns of this book were very clever. it was like I was in a maze, constantly coming up against a wall. The small amount of romance in the book was not at all distracting and gave Jordan some softness and emotional vulnerability that she may have lacked otherwise."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I've been caught by the juicing bug, and I looked into which ones had the best performance. This one has been great, I've already made several gallons of juice from it in only a couple of days. It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Some people have complained that centrifugal juicers are bad at leafy greens, but I've done kale, spinach, and parsley, and I'm getting the amount of juice from them as I'd expect."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Not my normal reading genre.

No murder.
No thrills.
No adventure.
No elves.
No weapons.
No car chases.
No mystery.
No spaceships.
No enemies.
No cowboys & indians.
No horror.
No court scenes.
No trips to Heaven.
No trips to Hell.
No spiritual battles.
No angels.
No demons.

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

Books_5,5.0,CG,"Great mystery with an incredible cast of characters.  The characters are complex, well developed and the plot is so well"
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.

The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.

I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.

The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Secret Smile.  Rate *****
A well acted and directed probably made for television as it was presented in 2 parts.  Started rather a bit slow but this Psychological thriller developed very excitingly as the time passes. Suspence prevaled as the minutes passed. I have not read the original novel by the now established Nicci French from which the script was adapted.
I don't like to get inside the mind of this psychopath whose mysteries smile was full of venom, while showing innocence.  I recommend that it. It is more than worth having this DVD in your library.
The quality of the transfer is very good as also the sound track.  It has a very exciting finale after all the jealousy, greed and revenge not to mention the innocent deaths.  Actors David Tennant (Casanova) and Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead) in my opinion were great.  Don't reviel the ending."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The romance genre seems to be going towards two distinctive trend right now; either it's paranormal (vampires, werewolves, psychics, etc.) or it's erotica.  With Sandra Hill, I am always guaranteed to read about Cajuns or Vikings.  This latest creation of the Vangils, I think is very crafty of Hill, a neopolitan dream of hunks for today's readers.  Yes there were some really gross scenes, I think Hill was taking inspiration from the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch in her descriptions.  Maybe a little too discriptive.  But as a romance novel, I see two people with massive issues coming together, fighting sizzling attraction and losing and at the end loving each other - it's all I can ask for in a romance novel.  Simple.  And lots of laughter in between.  Thanks, Sandra."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I watched ""One Step Beyond The Official First Season"" over the past 3 days. The show is finally getting the release it deserves.

First - Let's get the only video flaw I found in the entire set out of the way:

In the first 45 seconds of the episode ""Echo"" (on disc 3)there was a good bit of scratches/spots from the original film stock. (most of which was pre-opening monologue and opening title) 45 seconds out of 9 hrs 21 min

That's it!

I noticed no missing frames, Jumps, splices, audio problems or the like anywhere in this set. The episodes were sharp and a joy to watch. I suspect this is from the best 35mm stock.

I have some public domain sets, and they were watchable, but this set blows them away! Stories like The Vision, Night of April 14th, The Dark Room, The Devil's Laughter, and The Return of Michael Campion really benefit from the remastering. There are also stories which I haven't seen in the PD issues.

The set is on three single-sided discs. The extras are somewhat minimal. The best being the extended ""The Bride Possessed"" which included a John Newland series promo that I'd never seen before. Also there is another promo, the Alcoa opening, the 1990's version titles, and a 4 min. 1991 audio interview with Don Mankiewicz (with read-along subtitles).

My 5 star rating takes into account the artistic merit as well as the video. I think these are fine stories well suited to these who enjoy Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone or Thriller.

One Step Beyond fans should really enjoy this well-done set.

For those unfamiliar, One Step Beyond (which began in 1959) was an anthology series which told stories of strange or supernatural events that were based on supposedly true documented cases. Subject matter included hauntings, premonitions, curses, thought transference, miracles, re-incarnation and other bizarre phenomenon."

She is used to being busy, to working and now she is unsure of herself. So she decides to work on herself while she is waiting for the next call.and that call is from Greg.

I don't know why, but there are 2 of the Billionaires that I was most excited to read about. Tristan, the super hot partner who is the ultimate man candy for Chelsea and Greg. Greg was the one that brought her too the other partners and the first partner she was with. In this story we not only get to see Gregs kinky nature but his teasing one too.

But after about 6 months the plastic piece that holds the hinge pin broke.  I tried to use it with just the one hinge but it was obvious that it would break too. They are made of plastic. For a litter box that cost almost $100 I would expect hinges that were made to last.  Some of the reviews I've seen show people actually placing these in living areas, with the door discreetly turned to the side. But after the hinges break and the door comes off it is not so attractive, have included pics. Will be moving to a bigger house so will need another litter box. I think I'll look at some other ones."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"I'm a huge shoe enthusiast, and have been wearing these shoes for a long time. I have one pair that I have had for years, and they're the most comfortable. They're made well, and I can wear them all day, all day. I'm always happy to have these shoes on my feet.

I'm also a big fan of the suede shoes, and will continue to purchase them as I wear them all the time. I like that the suede sole is not too slippery, and that the color is a little brighter than I expected. They are a little too tight, but that's good because they're soft and comfortable. I'm not a big fan of the color, and I'm not sure if they'll hold up.

I'll be wearing these around the house, and I'll look for a pair of shoes that I can wear all day, no matter what I'm doing. I love the fit, the quality, and the quality of the leather. They're comfortable, but not too tight. I'll be wearing them around the house, and I'll be sure to wear them around the house.

I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it! He looks great with it! He loves it! I will buy more!Love these shoes.  They are so comfortable and fit perfect.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed this story. Hud and Mack are great! It is the third book in the series but can be read by itself (or first) without any problem whatsoever. It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It was a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I was missing something somewhere. I really enjoyed the characters and this story.
I received a copy in exchange for an honest review."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I remember seeing this film so long ago, and the story always fascinated me. Yeah it's an old black and white, but that's what makes it so classic.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I just love this bracelet.

It came in a nice blue box, like others have said, the stickers do not remove easily for re-use, but you could always put your own sticker over it if you wanted to re-use the box.

Inside the box was a black suede drawstring pouch sitting atop the foamy padding in generally find in jewelry packing.

As for the bracelet itself, it's beautiful.  My 18 yr daughter loves it, so I imagine I'll be sharing.

It feels rather luxurious to be wearing all of these pearls, which are intertwined with a dark brown string and crystals.  The crystals have a great sparkle to them which adds an element of bling to the pearls.  The pearls are large in size, and definitely potato shaped.

The pearls do have markings on them which do appear to be from tools, many of the pearls are unmarked though and I don't feel like it distracts from the beauty.

As for the brown cord, it clearly shows the brown cord in the photos, so it's to be expected and I don't mind it one bit.

The size of the bracelet is a bit on the small size.  I am smaller boned and don't have tiny wrists, but they are probably smaller than average and I feel most comfortable using the extender when clasping the bracelet together.

All in all, this is a bracelet that I will wear a lot.  With the coloring you can easily wear it with jeans just as well as with a more glamorous outfit for a night out."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I wish I were eloquent enough to convey just how much I loved and apprecciated the feelings this movie evoked in me when I watched it the first time.  Each dream or vignette is distinct and yet somehow connected.  My favorite was the 'peach orchard' segment.  It was so stunningly beautiful it brought me to tears.  The colors were unparalleled and the message was clearly yet sensitively conveyed.  It is not a movie with the traditional beginning, middle and end.  It is separate 'dream' sequences that fit together in an unusual but highly effective way. I love all of Kurosawa's movies, but this is a special piece I will hold in my heart forever."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Have had this camera since March, and I love it. I had a Digital Elph before this, so I was a little spoiled by how tiny they are and how easily they fit into a pocketbook, but this one can fit, too... just a little bulkier because of the ""hump"" for the batteries.

It takes clear pictures and video, has withstood my dropping it, and does a good job of focusing on faces.

Two negatives: first, the lag between photos can be unbearable, particularly when the flash has been discharged. I tried taking pictures in a theatre and had to wait literally about 30 seconds in between shots... which is terrible when you're trying to capture something as it's happening! When I loaned the camera to someone, she told me, ""I'd return it if I were you. I have no idea how you stand that.""

Thing is, I love just about everything else about it. If I had the money, I'd buy a different camera to use indoors and keep this one for the outdoors/good lighting shots.

The other negative is that it really isn't great with red eyes. My whole family is prone to red eyes, and haven't yet found a camera that reliably fixes that problem.

Good thing for the chin strap because you would not want the hat to blow off while sitting up high in the stadium seats.  I noticed other tennis enthusiasts had similar OR hats, but I was very pleased with mine and glad I purchased it online.  And it's a good thing the hat can be put into a washing machine because it did get a little dirty after three days of wear.  The best feature of the hat is that the back extends down far enough to cover the neck and keep it from being burned by the sun.

The book is both entertaining and enlightening, and it is a truly readable and well-written book. Bradbury is an American with an excellent knowledge of science and math.

This one is duck and as I have said about other treat and dog food products by this company, they seem to be a solid company making a safe and solid product for dogs.  These treats as little solid but chewy strips.  After she smelled it, it was gone in a flash and I have to say she is a bit of a picky eater.  She will not eat Milkbones and she is the first dog that I have ever had that will not eat them.  So, I consider this a very good treat."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.

The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.

While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Received a copy of the title in exchange for an honest review.

This was a super quick, sweet little read that follows a jaded journalist and a male romance novelist. I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac. The reader goes through the entire emotional wheel with Sheridan as she's told she's not getting the assignment she wants, and then through her falling process.

Like I said, I wish it had been longer, but this is a good taste at the writing of Sara Hantz"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Silver magic series is perhaps my favorite by this author. And this second book is the natural follow-up to the first. Everyone's favorite Dees from the first book, Glass, here has her chance to try life as a human. And she quickly lands herself in a heap of trouble, along with a romantic intrigue.

This book features the same imaginative inventiveness as the first book, and the same colorful characters. The Dees are wonderful as always. But the author's most brilliant characters, in my mind, are the Brothers Grimm. metaphysical hit men who live by their own convoluted code. This pair is calling for their own book. But let's get back to the book at hand, which is grand enough in it's own right.

I don't want to reveal too much, but if you thought the Dees were magnificent in defense of the Howard mansion, just wait until you see them turned loose in this book."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people."

Lately, Bryce was having little control of his bear and his brothers were keeping a close eye on him. He knew that Alana was in Star Lake Forest and roaring went to meet her. He didn't trust her. With much effort Alana persuaded him that the source of the problems was the Hollow losing its magic. She told him that something was draining its magic and she was the only one who could fix it. But she was lying to Bryce. She needed Liz to help her because her powers had weakened. It wasn't easy to deal with Brandon, Liz mate. He was suspicious and harsh with Alana. He could not forget Alana nearly had Liz killed. But the Hollow was in much danger it. It was worse than what they thought. The warlock, Alavar, had been Alanas mentor and was the one stealing the Hollow magic. He was a warlock dealing in black magic. They would have to fight him because without the Hollows magic the Mitchells would die. In this third story we get to know all about the Mitchells curse. Why Alana cursed Bryce and his brothers as collateral damage? I was very curious about what happened ten years ago that split them apart. Alana cannot forget Bryce did to her and Bryce could not have the woman he wanted because what Alana did. Way to keep the mystery of the situation. The author kept me intrigued from the first book. The development of the story was very interesting with much suspense, drama, action, and sex. Touching the scenes between Alana and Liz. Much feelings in there. This was the best of the three books of the Mitchells brothers. I knew it would be juicy. Love this stories.

Daryl is a polar bear shifter in the Tennessee Honey band. He is older then the reat and has felt alone for sometime. While taking a dip, he meets Matt who happens to see him in his polar bear form. Matt's dad is a grizzly shifter and not the best person (even though Matt has been sheltered from this information). When Daryl meets Matt's mom Alison, there is a connection between them two of them. Alison doesn't want to act on it due to her ex and believes Mat should come first. Matt is getting to the age of shifting, so Alison ask Daryl to talk with Matt. During this time, everyone becomes closer including Daryl and Alison.

Can Alison over come her fears of losing Matt? Is Daryl willing to take a chance and stay with them?

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The book for review is Legacy of Fear by Ryshia Kennie. It falls in the genre of mystery with romance tossed in.

The setting is Honk King. Andra, a young woman who now lives here gets the shock of her life when she finds her neighbor across the hall dead. Did they mean to get Andra?

Arriving on the seen is Max, a linguist who is trying to solve a puzzle that has landed in his lap in the form of a doll with the message, Find my heart. Find my girl. Why is he set to locate Andra? He needs her to crack the code of the message and the reason why it was set to him.

This starts off the pair in finding a mythical village that is run by and populated strictly by women. They need to learn a lost language to solve this mystery. Toss in men who are after you at ever turn, the plight of our characters just intensifies.

I do have one part of the book that left me flat. This is not a big book. I get the fact that Max and Andra who start off as friends start to like each other to where they get romantic. While I am not someone who likes reading romance in a book, if it is done in the right amount I am okay with this. The amount of scenes where we saw these characters expressing their feelings for each other and their interludes to me was too much and less would have been just as effective and the point would have been made just as well. I wanted to get on to the mystery and not turn a page and yet again see them being lovey toward each other.

This was a quick read, and you could easily read it in a short time. I loved the story line of the village, language and how it was all tied into a doll that was delivered to Max. That really was fun to read. Overall, this is a good read and for the price you truly cant go wrong."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I really liked American Mary and it could have been a stellar film if the writers had paid a little more attention to the story and the plot - subplots they laid out.
Why the detective isn't immediately checking out the strip club Mary frequents is ludicrous considering everything else he knows about the case, and why after years of these rape parties hosted by the elite doctors of this university no one has spoken up is a pretty damn big stretch.
And what was that bizarre ""romance"" between the strip club owner and Mary? It seemed quite the afterthought.

All that aside, the look of the film, the effects, the acting and the plastic surgery disasters (Betty Boop and Barbie) are superb. Disturbing and effective creations indeed."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using the small Lasko heater for a couple of years now, and finally decided to upgrade to this bigger unit.  I like the small ones, but there are two problems - they offer very focused (almost painful) heat if you are too close, but are too small to sit farther away from them and still feel warm, and they don't heat up a large space.

This version is GREAT.  It's big enough that you don't have to be right next to it to get warm, it heats up my big room relatively quickly, and I *love* that it shuts itself off when it hits a certain temperature (my other Lasko does not).  This was well worth the money.  My other Lasko has lasted three years and is still going strong (I use it at work), so I expect this one will last for years, as well.  A great purchase."

Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,"First and foremost they claim this is an BBW romance. The author never mentuons that in the book but they do talk about all the time in the gym she spends and how proud she is of her body and her beauty. How he touches her taut abs and toned legs and so on. Yes you can be curvy and fit but I didn't get that from this book. I feel like she is a skinny gym rat. The book itself starts out so boring I  had to force myself to keep reading. It picked up a little at the end but the ""twists"" in the story didn't  intrest me and where kind of sick. Only a handful if males can mate and she was kidnapped after concieving from one night. Then she gets passed around to the brother. They expect her to have sex with him, which she does, and have 20 babies. Then with the upheavals all she is is a vessel. When I read a romance I  do not expect the heroine to have to have sex with different people and be treated like a baby making whore. I am begging anyone reading this review to pass on this book. I don't  know  where all these 5 start reviews came from but they had to have been paid.  Just not a good read to me. I am glad it was on KU or I would  be asking for a refund since it is definitely  not a rereadable book."

I don't know how I would feel if I had read this book and I'm not sure if it would have made me more sympathetic towards her.  I felt like I was reading a story about Holly and her family, but I didn't feel like I was going to enjoy the book, which I did.

Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,"Boy did I go wrong with this book. I didn't know this had so much sexual content and far too little Sci-Fi. There was no need to have physical and sexual abuse and I stopped reading because that was where it was going. I'm not pleased because had I been warned in the blurb I wouldn't have gotten this to start with.

My copy came from Net Galley, Im sure they didn't know that it was not rated properly there. I left this review to warn others so that they didn't make the same mistake I did, thinking this was Sci-Fi. This review is entirely all my own."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This is my second book from this author. My first was ""Honor's Splendour"", a historic romance novel, which I really loved. Garwood managed masterfully to describe her main characters and convey excellently the medieval atmosphere.

However, nothing like this was achieved in ""Heartbreaker"". My feelings concerning this book are very mixed. There were good moments and I sometimes even smiled at the one or the other verbal attack. But the story never really ""took off"".  Maybe this was because the ""chemistry"" between Nick and Laurant didn't really work?  Maybe the story line was just poor and badly elaborated? I can't put my finger on it; in any case it just didn't work out for me."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This book had captured my attention as I had read one of her books from her series Love's Great Adventure and what appealed most was that this book was to be set in New Zealand and since I am from New Zealand, I enjoy books set here. The book starts over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She moves to Auckland where she has an IT job and moves next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book goes along we read as Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the language as being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do things here and our language. The author used phrases like Kia Ora as hello since the character next door was Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writers to grasp the different cultural differences and language. Overall though it was only tiny things that unless you are from New Zealand, you wouldn't notice or pick up.  Honestly, if you are on the lookout for a lovely second chance at happiness and romance story then By My Side is the book for you."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,"It is important to know that the author does not try to appeal to the masses. Instead, the story is told from the point of view of the reader. This is a very interesting premise. It is hard to imagine a book that would be better if it was written from the point of view of a young woman. I found it difficult to connect with the characters at all. I could not connect with the characters at all. I could not connect with the main characters. I could not connect"

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Confidence is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that has also hopped to the top of the to buy list for me."

She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she forgot it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought my sg3 brand new about 5/6 yrs ago, it still works like a champ til this day. Played a round this past Saturday.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles like the newer models, but its accurate, links to the satellite in 1 or 2 mins, gives me carried yardage, hazard yardage (front and carry), distance to middle, front and back of greens, you can use the small joystick to place the pin in appropriate place on green for more accurated pin yardage. It has a score feature, but it takes to long to get to the next hole, so I have this feature turned off. All in all, I LOVE IT, they don't make this model anymore, but I bet the refurbished sg3 is just as good, unless your into color screens, touch screens and other things that slows your game down.  This one gives you what you need, accurate yardage to hazards, lay ups and pin, so all you need is good golf shot. Oh yea, it takes 2 AA batteries that last approximately 2 rounds and you pay for the courses, but its a minimal yearly subscription and the website is very easy to use and downloads or quik"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Good book!!! Snipers are definitely an important asset to the military. But I was frustrated by what the book represented. The stupidity of the insurgents, the politics being played in Washington regarding the military, and the egos in the military with regard to helping each other in the time of war.  But it is important to note the people in the trenches were there for a purpose they believed in and were there to cover each others back. The book was an eye opener about the general state of our world and what goes on. Not very promising future for our children.  I really appreciated the sacrifice of Chris's wife and kids, and I also appreciated the work Chris continued to do for our veterans after he got out of the military."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"A comic novel about the love affairs of a sophisticated, thirtyish single woman living alone in a big city and working in television - sound familiar? If you haven't read Bridget Jones's Diary yet you may be more impressed by the originality of this. Of course lack of originality doesn't detract from entertainment value. Maybe we should just accept that there is now a genre/category (sometimes called called chick-lit) within which some authors chose to write. The heroine, called Jane Goodall is pre-occupied with a man who rejects her (plot lifted from Virgil's about Aeneas and Dido) and plans revenge (plot lifted from Euripides about Medea and Jason) which she does by writing  (derived from evo-psychology) magazine articles about why men are unfaithful to their lovers. The quotations from animal behavior studies are among the best jokes.
  It has some penetrating insights and funny satirical patches and it kept me interested and reading to the end."

For me, that's fine, but for the girls I went ahead and bought them some pre-looped straps that are easier to use and adjust."
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around."

She pushed it around the living room for the first afternoon, but then gave up and never touched it again. I ended up bringing it over to a friends house for his much larger retriever and even she could barely fit this in her mouth.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"My theory is fiction writers (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists.  Every psychiatrist I know has gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis.  Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies.  If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude.

Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption.  We are introduced to each character in terms of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional.  (What is Schickler's own personal flaw?  Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss).  Each of these flaws is at the core of Schickler's stories.  The stories focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex.  We eavesdrop on each characters fantasies and insecurities.  (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy).  One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women.  Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious.  The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practices that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's dates had better be suspicious of nice diners).

In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with names changed to protect the innocent.  It's a book about losers scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling women allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.  That man's name is David Schickler."

I also like the fact that the blade is very easy to clean and that the blades are on a smooth surface. I love that they come with a tray for easy storage, but I really like that they come with a small trash can for storage, and that they have a magnet on one side for easy storage.

The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.

The quality is good. They have light treads though not sure if they make much of a difference in grip.

The only thing is that you have to get over your initial embarrassment at asking people to put them on. Still, it's better than asking folks to take their shoes off."

If you just see the picture with no scale, it could look like a duffel bag!  This is a small, compact bag with a few straps/compartments that can be useful as a compact ""go bag"" or first aid kit.  For now it seems quite sturdy though it hasn't been tested/stressed much yet.

I keep it loaded with first aid gear, a flashlight, batteries, utility knife, firestarter, and tinder.  There's still enough room for a subcompact pistol and two clips if needed.

This easily stashes in my trunk or can be grabbed and carried with minimal effort.

It's not for everyone but it will serve its purpose if you realize its size and plan accordingly!"

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Proof positive that what makes as great movie is the writing.  Don't get me wrong, this film looks great, but you can tell it did not have the giant blockbuster budget that some films have, but the director and camera crew make it look like a million dollars anyway.  And more importantly it has fantastic script, mood, and great actors! This is a thnking man's, or woman's, movie. it is also very much in the film noir vein.  Films to compare it to would be Dark City or the first Boerne Identity movie.  Through out the movie our main character has identity issues and as has been stated previously, Jeremy Northam's tranformation is incredible, subtle, and in my opinion, Oscar worthy! It has been said by some that the plot has holes or doesn't make sense in places. I have plotted it out meticullously and i can find a hole anywhere.  Because the plot is involved it is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. Much like watching ""The Usual Suspects"" for the second & third time. Something else I think is noteworthy is that while most of the movie is kind of cold and lonely,as it should be, as our hero goes on his quest where no one can be trusted, at the very end of the movie we are treated to a very warm, hopeful, satisfying ending. All the cast are perfect.  Lucy Lui has the perfect demeanor for this role. Many times it is hard to read her and thereby to know if she can be trusted.  Finally, let me end with stating this is in my Top-10 movies of all times along with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  In the Mouth of Madness by John Carpenter, as well as many other horror and Sci-fi films.  I watched more times than I can count and will probably go watch it again here in a minute. A real treat for anyone who has not seen it yet!"

It is not detected by their support helper application and does not seem to have the ""service tag"" that is needed to find drivers and other software for your machine. There's tons of software to choose from one you do find it, but it's pure luck to download and install the correct software as everything is named the same and not labeled appropriately for specific machines and operating systems (it LOOKS like it is, but I have downloaded many packages for this device that indicate my specific laptop and OS, only to get a message that says :this software does  not work with this machine"" upon trying to install.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"I had a couple of issues with the design, which I will admit was due to the fact that the two adjustable blades are plastic, which is not the case with this model. The saw is well made and will cut your projects as you wish. The saw itself is not as sharp as a saw with a single adjustable blade, but it's not that sharp as a saw with two adjustable blades. I highly recommend this model. I have a few other saws that are very similar to this model, but I would prefer the two blades. Bottom line:  This saw is a great value. It's not cheap, but it's a good value. I would definitely recommend this saw to anyone."

I have been using the ab wheel for about four months with really great results. This is not strong enough to support rollouts from standing if you are over 185 lbs. I can do them and they work, but the smaller wheel size makes it more challenging. I travel internationally and this is great to throw in your suitcase - weighs nothing and travels great."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This set includes 5 different animals that are on the endangered species list.  There is a black rhinoceros, manatee, giant panda, cheetah, and albatross.  The animals all have great detail. The wrinkles on the rhino and manatee are realistic.  They are well made from a thick plastic.  The set also comes with an activity guide.  The activity guide gives lots of great information about each of the animals in the set.  It gives information like why the animal is endangered, where they live, and special characteristics.  It also gives discussion starters and a couple of activities.

I opened it up and my son immediately asked questions.  He started to name the couple he knew.  I corrected or helped with the couple he didn't know.  We talked about the animals and a little about each.  I told him they are all endangered and of course he asked what that meant.  We talked a little about them, but mostly he just likes to pretend play with them.  He was pretending today that the manatee was swimming really fast and then he broke his tail so he was swimming slow and then it got better and he went fast.  Such a 4 year old play game.  There is so much play that can happen with these animals.  Pretend play is such a valuable skill to learn and why not add in some other learning.

  The Jumbo Endangered Animals are for ages 2 years and up.  I really think they can be used for many years.  There are so many learning uses for these animals.  Any child that likes animals would love these.  They would make a great gift."
Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This was the 4th leapster game I gave my 5 yr old; she loved it at first. Played it ALL the time.  I was even addicted to it. Unfortunatly, like most games, once you play a long time and master the skills asked...there is little left to do.  The biggest drawback on this one is there is a store you can go to, to buy items for your dog after you earn coins throughout the game...well, my daughter went and bought out all the items as soon as she had the money to do so...then kept going back to the store and realized, they don't restock. So then she stocked up on like 50 bottles of shampoo, water, and dog food :)  Cute, but then she got really frustrated that the screen was really useless at that point and really never needs to go there again.

These dogs do everything, including ""Potty Time""!  Its a really cute game, just wish there were more upgrades, or updates you could download for it to keep the interest in it going.  It drives our cats crazy when my daughter plays it near them b/c the dogs bark all the time, they sound so real!

I would recommend this game; with the knowledge, they will bore of it....eventually...however, I have yet to find a game my daughter doesn't bore of after a few weeks of play."

Just when I thought that Stan Law couldn't stretch my thoughts and imaginings any further; he proves me wrongagain! This book really pushes the mental boundaries on what religion is and what it means and had left me in contemplation for several hours after reading. Sacha is the son of Alec and Suzy and believes that he is not of this world. He is very gifted from a young age and obsesses over the idea that he has to accomplish something. Whatever your view on religion or the human mind is, I definitely think that this book is worth reading. The build up all through this trilogy has been amazing and Im slightly disappointed that it has come to an end.

The author has a way of painting the picture of a typical military situation, and the cover of this book is a bit confusing. It's clear that the author is writing as a civilian, and the military is not a military organization. I guess it's a military-specific perspective, since the military is not a military organization. The military organization is a separate entity, and it is not very interested in what it is doing, and how it is doing it. There is no direct relationship between the military and the civilian, and the book is mostly about the military's attitude toward the civilian.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"To everyone who surrounds Margo Roth Spiegelman, she is an adventurous, unconventional, and intelligent person and a highly admired someone that everyone puts on a pedestal. So when Margo sneaks into Quentin Jacobsen's room one glorious night and involves him in her crazy exploits, he can't help but feel as if a new page has been turned, and just maybe he can be a part of the marvelous Margo's life.

But the next morning all of Quentin's hopes are dashed with Margo's disappearance. Her parents and the police think this is just another one of her stunts, but Q's not so sure. Because Margo has left him a string of clues, one right after another, which just might lead him to her. But the thing is, he's not sure what he'll find.

John Green brings readers another surprising, witty, and fully honest book in Paper Towns. His writing is captivating from the very beginning as multitudes of details, no mater how large of small, flow seamlessly together. Green has a knack for highlighting the little distinguishing factors that make us human, making for more believable characters and completely enthralling book.

The mystery in Paper Towns is clever, and will leave readers scratching their heads as Q and his friends struggle to piece together the clues with some frustration and tons of humor. But the teens are just as quick to get serious as they contemplate what has actually happened to Margo and as Quentin especially comes to see her in a completely different light with a little help from the poetry of Walt Whitman.

Though Paper Towns did slow down a little bit in the middle of the book as Quentin hits a brick wall in his search, this novel is suspenseful, hilarious, and quirky, and especially appealing to the well read teen. The characters are as real as your own friends, and teens can't help but see pieces of their own lives in this amazingly candid book. Read at your own risk though--Green's works are completely addictive, and once you start, it's impossible to stop."

I like the dubbed version because of the excellent quality of Enrico Maria Salerno's voice as Christ. This film has one of the most effective uses of music on film, and the direction is pure poetry. It also remains faithful to the words and emotional feel of Matthew's gospel, and it captures nuances from the other gospels as well. I have been disappointed with other transfers of this film to DVD, but this one works the best for me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I've been using these as condiment bottles, filled with condiments from our bulk sized containers. The tips are pretty small, but I like that for condiments that aren't meant to be chunky (so, not relish). I started using one for pancakes awhile back, and occasionally the tip would get clogged from the batter, I noticed then that the tips are pretty thick, and I couldn't cut through one to change the size. I ended up taking a sharp knife with a fine point and kind of carved away at the opening to make it just a bit bigger. A friend also took a file type thing to hers, it's like a long chopstick, but the entire surface was a file.
Anyways, I've liked these well enough, and I'm glad I got them."

I have two of these fence-boards and also a miter slot board.  Love 'em.  The 5/16"" t-bolts that these come with this work well in the fence slots I made using a slot-cutting bit from Lee-Valley/Veritas.  I should mention that they do not fit in the slots on my Ridgid table saw fence, which uses 1/4"" slots.  If I want to use these on my table say, I will need some 1/4"" bolts.  No big deal.  Highly recommended."

I have tried to keep them on my truck because they are so much fun to have around.  They work great, they are very easy to install and you can put them in a door or window and put them in a closet or a basement.  I have to say that they work great for my garage.  The only thing I would change is the batteries.  I have had a few failures with them, but I have no regrets.  They are very well made and they are very well made.  I would highly recommend this product.My husband loves this shower head.  He loves the fact that it has a very soft setting and it's so easy to adjust.

I purchased this for a new puppy and immediately thought it was a unique, easy to manipulate product.
This was short lived with each time I removed and replaced a stake in the attaching wall units. I first found my puppy chewing on the top cap that this company merely attaches by hand with no adhesive to ensure safety issues such as this. I wasn't happy to find an item my dog could have choked on in her ""safety"" area; I simply reattached it using crazy glue. The next morning I found an new one on the ground in his dog bed that he had thankfully hadn't found. Needless to say, this ""Exercise Playpen"" is now in the garbage.

I have been wearing them for about 3 years and I can tell they are comfortable. They do run a little small, but I think they are a good size. I wear a size 8.5, and these run a little large. I would say that if you are a size 7, they are going to fit you, but if you are a size 8, they will not. I have had them for a few months now, and I do think that they are very comfortable. They are not bulky at all, but if you are a size 7, they will make you feel very comfortable. These are a good buy.This is a good quality wallet.  I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've used this battery on a D50, D80 and D200. I bought 2 EN-EL3e's because most of my Nikon bodies provide very conservative battery power readings. If you are a Nikon user, you'll probably realize that Nikon has geared their Nikon digital camera bodies with memory card space and battery power meter with a ""glass is half empty"" approach. I was doing a shoot with my D80 and I thought I had a defective EN-EL3e because after 200 shots, the battery meter stated I had 44% battery power left. I ended up shooting well over 1000 shots and the meter was flickering from 30% to 60%. The same behaviour happened with my D50 and D200. Bottom line, Nikon's digital camera bodies have very inaccurate battery level meters. The EN-EL3e has a TON of juice on 1 charge and I am very pleased with it."

This movie is hilarious -- definitely a ""Spinal Tap"" for country music....but it's not a rip-off of Spinal Tap.  Even if you aren't a fan of Country music, you should see this movie...it's funny and has a cast of some great actors/actresses.  I hope that this film someday sees the light of day (i.e. major distribution).  It was originally only available as a rental (or as a purchase on VHS) from Blockbuster.  But it's so much better than that.  In Summary:  A great parody that I can watch again and again."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Ms Wylde does it again in this second installment of the Fairweather Sisters. I enjoyed reading it especially George (Lord Elmer's) antics.

I like how the author laces humor in this genre and manages to explain the difference between true love and infatuation.

Celine/Amy has her head over the clouds blinded by love when she loved those hideous poems. When she and George fought both of them made sense and I liked how they improved for each other.

Of all the places a duchess could give birth to, only Penelope could pull it off. Both Celine/Amy and George had brushes with danger and they always manage to get out unscathed.

I'd highly recommend this novel to those of you looking for a fun and light reading. Some scenes were hilarious I literally laughed out loud. More power Ms Wylde!"

Books_5,5.0,CG,"I always enjoy finding a good book and this one is no exception.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed.  The main character, a young American boy named Nicholas, is not the typical kid.  Instead, he is a young man who is raised by a strong family.  He is a very special person, and it is his father who is a mentor to him.  Nicholas is very talented, and the story is very well told.  The story is told in a very specific way, and it is very difficult to imagine it in a fiction format.  Instead, I found it very interesting to read the stories told by the characters.

The plot of the book was very interesting, and the characters were believable.  I enjoyed the way they developed their personalities.  They were both very real people, and I found it very interesting to read about their lives.  The main character, who is not always very popular with the general public, is also very popular with the general public, and his personality and background were also very interesting.

Sweet romance is probably a better term for the writer's style.  She has an eye for detail that brings the people to life.  And she has an eye for attraction so she can communicate it in suble ways.

That being said, I did love the other characters, Ashely and Grant. I want to read their story. They intrigued me. I'm hoping that they do get a story.

I would recommend it.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear he can use in his home.  This is not a tactical vest for him, but it is well made and will help him to organize his gear.  The included pockets are nice and easy to access.  This vest is super lightweight and packs well in a small case.  It's great for his training and practice.  I would definitely recommend this to any tactical person.  Great product for a good price.  My husband also loves it.  I have used it for about a year and it still works perfectly.  It does not have the rust of a vest that I use for other vest"

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

I would recommend this pan for anyone who is looking for a pan that will hold up to heavy usage, or just someone who is looking for a pan that is easy to clean, but doesn't have a lot of storage space.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I kept feeling like this man must have been to these places where warlords rule. The warlords, the economy, child soldiers all of it was brought to life, but in the context of upper-class America. The book is dark, but it's not actually dark enough to fully bring it to life. However, I think that's a good thing, because the reality is so horrific that it would damage his relationship to his readers. It's enough. I say this as someone who has published for West Point on the subject of warlords. Paolo has the dynamics of the soldier boys down. I kept wondering, ""Did this guy live it?"" which is about as good a compliment as one can give an author.

His creatures are very good. There are coywolves, also called red wolves. That bounced me out of the story a bit, but then I realized that he connected me into the world that way. The genetically engineered creature named Tool was interesting. I found myself wondering how to make him, and realizing that he could be made, one at a time as a chimera, through surgery in utero. Which was a bit of a brrr, moment. The conditioning though, that would be harder.

It's good sci-fi, but it's more than just a story. It gives an opportunity for Americans to feel what it's like to be caught up in such madness. The madness exists today - even now.

The one thing I would have liked though, is for the Drowned Cities to run piracy operations like is done off the coast of Somalia. (It won't surprise me if Libya starts doing it too, but inside the Mediterranean it can't be ignored as much as Somali.) That's a tiny miss to his economy of the cities.

By the way, the Zulus - on theory about this tribe is that they descended from a lost Roman garrison on the southern end of the empire after Rome disintegrated. The garrison became a tribe with roots in military traditions, much like the depiction of the warlord armies of the Drowned Cities."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Eve Fortescue is back in Bellefleur, Lousisanna in hopes to convince Brent Bellefleur, groom-to-be, that she is the one he should marry ~ not Honey Moreau.  As a guest of the upcoming nuptials, Eve also has the uncomfortable pleasure of attending the pre-wedding dinner being held at the Bellefleur Country Club.  Here is where Eve is going to strike while the iron is still hot.  As she enters the country club, she latches onto the first unpaired male she can find and requests him as her date.  And she walks right into the web of Brent's cousin, Rainer Delacroix.  He makes her an offer she doesn't refuse and her seduction of the groom-to-be takes a different turn in the road.

Eve Met Her Match has a wickedly seductive kissing scene that leaves the reader breathless right along with the characters involved.  There are also some very swoon-worthy actions that make reading this short novella quite enjoyable.  The descriptions of each scene were adequate and well-written.  They don't bog down the story with useless details or babble.

At first, there is a bit of disdain for Eve.  I mean, she's only coming to the wedding to try and steal the groom away from a woman Eve used to call her friend.  Many of the secondary characters (guests that also attend the pre-wedding dinner) have no trouble seeing through Eve's charade.  It's perfectly clear what Eve's intentions are that evening.  Fortunately, she lands in the lap of Rainer, who does a sexy wicked job of seducing Eve and getting her to open her eyes and really take a look around.

This novella is sweet, sexy, and wickedly fun.

I showed my mom this book and this is the same weight loss approach that she has been using and she has been losing weight very steadily. I'm so excited to start. With no major holidays coming up, I'm going to start immediately. Another thing I really liked about the book is how the author tells more about herself and her life than just the diet period.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"INVENTING GEORGE WASHINGTON:  AMERICA'S FOUNDER IN MYTH AND MEMORY is an interesting look into some of the many stories we've all heard about George Washington.  Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myths themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reasons behind their origination.  While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real sources of George Washington quotes and lore that Lengel exposes.

While some were innocent enough embellishments upon actual events or wholly made-up fiction, the reasons behind others are far from innocent.  Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the ends of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delves into the prevelance of the mythology in todays world.

Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writings directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myths retain their seeming veracity.  Whether taken from forged writings of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirers or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these stories in todays modern era--usually to serve modern political ends.

While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion as to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind:  Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify its sourcing.  As to the legends?  Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the hearts of his countrymen.""

I give this book FOUR STARS.  Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington.  Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for stories and qoutes being bandied about today!"

I recently purchased the Odd Couple from Time Life as well because it was one, available and two, was something I was waiting for to come out on dvd. Furthermore, I wanted to see an much less expensive version of a time life dvd. It's terrific and I absolutely love those dvds. They've all been remastered and there are tons of extras. So I ordered the Get Smart series a couple weeks ago and I can't wait to receive them. I hope they are the same quality as the odd couple ones because I was extremely happily surprised with them."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.

I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.

It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.

I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.

I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.

It's a very quiet fountain.  You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound.  I don't unplug it at night.  It runs 24/7."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Technically, this is a romantic suspense which actually kept me guessing until the three-quarters of the book yet the love story Alan Mellington and Sarah Montgomery remained first and foremost in the storyline.

The serendipitous way they found each other and how their love for each other developed despite the social class barrier of early 19th century England is worth the read. Even the zealousness of a misguided local religious leader and how gossip leading to slander can hurt the innocent were described with no holds bar.

There is also good discussion about faith which will interest Christian readers.

This book is PG 13 due to situational drama. There are no sex scenes in this book."

When set to the most sensitive setting, the lights were picking up passing cars on the street, so I had to use the mid-range setting, which detects moving objects on my property but not in the street.

I have a similarly sized hard anodized professional skillet, but the convenience of a nonstick finish and glass lid was irresistible.

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food. The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

Cleanup is easy, just scrub out with warm water, mild soap and a nylon brush. Wipe dry and stow away.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking to add variety to my breakfast with egg, ham and English muffin sandwiches. I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a poorly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings for the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked for the link so she could order a set."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think)."

I had read some other reviews that expressed concern about the quality of the welding joints, but that was not the case in the front or rear racks that I purchased for my Surly Disc Long Haul trucker. Surly may have tightened up their quality control after receiving complaints about the welding.  The package includes LOTS of mounting hardware that allows you to use several options to mount the rack.  About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability. I had purchased an alloy rack of a similar design and do not see much difference in weight.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book"
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Got this book also because it was included in many of the Berkelee School of Music Business courses.

Another great aspect of this book is that there is a companion website that you can go to for current links and news relevant to the topics discussed in the book. The website alone is full of valuable resources and information once you get through this bad boy.

Would definitely recommend to the beginner as well as the novice for its ease of read (got through the whole thing in about 2 days) and for the information within.

This was so similarly written, right down to the same phrasing that it was a huge let down.  The main plot problem was different it was a lame problem.

This was a disappointing story.  I have never seen so much difficulty made out of one kiss.  The Hero could have confided the 'secret' but do to loyalty, he doesn't.  He loyalty was not admirable, it was annoying.

Everything that I loved in the first book, the common sense, the humor, the sensitivity to a difficult subject is either over-worked or just mundane, the second time around.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I enjoyed this mermaid tale. I learned a lot about mermaids by reading this interesting book. The book was a nice mix of fiction and fantasy. It was an enjoyable read and the book shows that the author is very talented at writing in various genres.

Oceania had just turned eighteen. She traveled to the surface of the ocean to experience life on dry land. Oceania soon met a young man named Xavier. It was love at first sight for both of them. They soon discovered that they both loved music and they enjoyed making music together. Soon it was time for Oceania to return to her home underwater. She convinced Xavier to make the trip with her.

Oceania's father was not very friendly to Xavier. In order for this unexpected relationship to work, one of the characters is going to have to give up the lifestyle they have known for their entire life. Read the book to find out if the young couple's love can survive the challenges of their very different lifestyles."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This has been one of my personal favorites of the McGee series. Travis is hired by a very famous movie star who is being blackmailed due to some photos that show her, in the old-fashioned phrase, in compromising positions. (With more than one guy). The novel was written before you could send pictures on cell phones. McGee must track down the members of the wild party and find out which one is the blackmailer. It's a very good plot as McGee studiously eliminates suspects. And finds some have died and some, possibly, murdered.
  McGee's love interest in this novel is the movie star's secretary who accompanies him on his travels. The reason given for this doesn't really hold up but, hey, she's essential to the plot.
  It was another firstrate Travis McGee novel."

-Easy to use
-Cons:
-Not as heavy as I had hoped for
-Very poor quality materials
-Very thin plastic

-Sturdy and sturdy, but my cats would not touch it

-The clasp is a little too small
-My cat is a big chewer and I thought this was a cute toy to hold in her mouth. She just pulls it out of her mouth and then shakes it around so the clasp slides down into her mouth. I feel like the clasp is too tight because she is very far away from it. I wish they had made this one a little bigger. I would have given it a 5. The clasp is very sturdy. The clasp is very comfortable. The clasp does not slip out of the clasp, so it is secure and secure. The clasp is very easy to put on and remove. I put a couple of extra screws in the clasp to tighten it up."

I am grateful for the stretchy fabric which allowed me to still wear it and be comfortable so I would recommend ordering larger than your size.  another pet peeve was the amount of glitter coming off of the dress on to my skin and when I took the dress off all of the residual black glitter .

The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that the main characters (the students) are just okay as actors.  The ROTC guy was the best.

Books_5,4.0,CG,"I read a bit here and there, and it just wasn't as good as the first one."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of the
picture and audio, is top-notch."

It was relatively easy to mount, I'm pretty handy, using a drill, socket wrench and level. If you don't know what those are then you will have problems getting this up on a wall. Don't skimp on the screws or hardware, you don't want this falling on someone. Mine is mounted into a stud and I can hang on the bracket (150lbs). The only issue I have is that it doesn't fold quite as flat to the wall as I had hoped, so if space is an issue then you may want a different mount. It does, however, swing and rotate exactly where we would like it."

The cast is well cast, and the acting is top notch. This season is still far from being the best season of the series, and it will be the last season of the series. I highly recommend this series for anyone who has not seen it before. It was an interesting movie, not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The story is very well told and the action scenes are just right for a comedy movie. Good movie, great story line, good characters. This is a very good movie. I like this movie. I don't know if it's for the kids or for adults. I was a little disappointed in the ending. I hope that people will watch this movie. This is a fun movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves this movie. I can't wait for the next one. It was ok, but not very good. I guess it was meant to be a comedy. Great series.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This complex novel, part science fiction, part alternate history, plays with ideas about the true nature of consciousness. It takes the reader into the minds of various real and imagined beings, including destroyers such as Francisco Pizarro, a son of Genghis Khan, and the Black Plague, as well as adherents of crackpot theories such as the Vril and orgone energy, and the mind of woman with schizophrenia. Historic figures, including Freud, Einstein, and Hitler also make their appearances.

If you enjoy the imaginations, mind games, and broad canvases of authors  like Umberto Eco or Philip K. Dick, you might enjoy this book. It doesn't quite reach their full heights of imagination, but it's still an intriguing exploration."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,CG,"About 15 minutes into the film, the movie gets a little slow. There is a lot of time left before we know the real story. The movie is very slow in a lot of ways. The opening scene is in the background, and it's not very good. There is no real story to tell.

I did like the fact that the opening scene was so short. I liked the fact that the movie took place in the 1950s. I think that's a bit of a stretch to say that the movie takes place in the 1950s. The first time I saw this movie, I was in a different time, and it was kind of depressing. It took place in the 1950s, and it was a bit of a shock to me. It's also a bit of a stretch to say that the movie takes place in the 1960s. There are a few things that I really liked about"

I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

Of course, they're useful only for bolts that are within reach, where you have plenty of room to rotate the wrench around the bolt head.

I really like that the tools themselves are very heavy and seem durable, but I'll update my review after I've used them for a while.

As another reviewer mentioned, this set ""...doesn't just replace 8 standard wrench sizes but also covers 6 fastener types, hex, square, 12pt, external torx, partially rounded hex and spline.""  Quite an impressive list.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I don't remember the last time I owned a hand vac.  Never been inclined to buy one before because the suction wasn't that great and they're difficult to keep clean.  This one has all the power I need and the battery (so far) hasn't been a problem.  So much so, I bought 2 more on a clearance sale.  As someone else said, I don't understand the negative comments.  The blower is at the bottom but so far I haven't had any problem with picking up dust and even feathers which get randomly get blown into my house.  The detachable cone is simple to undo and empty however on the down side, the filter is not that easy to clean.  Dust, especially if you try washing it, gets stuck between the crevices.  Also, the crevice and brush tool don't snap in so they easily pop out.  Had to apply a bit of duct tape."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"It's so handy to have a second charging cable.  Now I can charge my Up3 either at home or at work.  This one actually seems to work better than the one that came with the band.  Maybe it has stronger magnets or something because I have a high success rate of connecting on the first try whereas the original almost always requires some ""finagling"" to get it to connect.  The long cord is a huge convenience too.  I have it plugged into a USB wall wart which easily reaches my desk top when I'm ready to charge the band.  Couldn't be more pleased with the product."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I'm not generally a fan of doing something that is negative reinforcement for my dogs, as I don't believe that 's really what works.  However, my poms were out of control when I went on walks, barking at every person or dog that we passed.  They really just wanted to say hello, but people would think they weren't friendly.  I needed something that would stop that behavior, and this worked well.  It only took a few times of using it, and now I can just show them the can, and they'll stop.  It just emits the sound of compressed air, which they don't enjoy.  It fits easily in my pocket to keep handy for when I need it.  If you've tried other things and need something that really works, this is worth a try."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I love my Healthy Human bottle! I have one. My husband has one. We have the metal pint glasses. It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"DEEP BLUE ALIBI by Paul Levine is a winner all around.  The mystery investigation and court scenes are intellectually stimulating and correct with a real ""got chya"" factor.  The humor between the characters is sophisticated and down right raunchy at times, but wonderful to come across as the book unfolds. The relationship between Steve Solomon (who is as clever and smart as the Bible's King Solomon, who decides to offer to divide a baby in half in order to find it's real mother) and Victoria Lord (whose brains, beauty, and emotional issues would via for Dr. Phil status with any God) are perfect characters to keep the mystery alive. Then add in [...] Bobbie, live-in nephew of Solomon whose ""savant"" traits make for more humor and interesting discoveries of facts for the reader. This book is an easy sell.  Evanovich for those who like to be classified as ""intellectual snobs"".  Bring on the whole series, and hurry please!!"

I love the fact that the Kindle Fire HD is an on/off switch that allows you to switch from the Kindle Fire HD to the Kindle Fire HD. I'm not sure why the switch was a little longer than expected but it worked great for me. I can't say enough about the sound quality of the Kindle Fire HD. It's amazing how well the sound is reproducing the sound of the Kindle Fire HD. It's not the best but I'm glad I got it. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try and get a good sound quality. Great buy. Works great. Only thing is the ear pads are a little stiff, so you need to use a tiny screwdriver to make them firm. The size of these is perfect.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first book I have read by Lucy Snow.  I have to say I was truly shocked at the book.  It was a very good read.  The hero and heroine in the book, Ronan, and Kara are developed and work real well together.  Kara's mother was married to Ronan's dad until she found out just he did for a living then she left and divorced him.  I loved how Ronan is trying to help Kara and yet has to fight to keep his feelings for his step sister to come out.  The way that the characters of Ronan and Kara are developed your taken on a ride that you will never forget.  Ronan wants Kara but he wants to be the head of his father's mob family one day, or so he thinks.  Kara is in serious trouble and the only person that can help her is her muscled, tattooed, handsome but evil step brother, Ronan.  Kara and Ronan both want each other, but can they stay away from each other?  Can Ronan protect her and yet do his job with the family?

If you have the TV plugged into the TV, it will not connect to the TV. It's very frustrating.

I had to hook up the HDMI cable to the TV to get it to work. This is a huge pain and takes a lot of time. I don't want to have to get the TV hooked up to the TV to make it work. It would be nice if there were a way to do that with the other cables.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?

One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.

This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!

The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"A longtime fan of the author, I was thrilled to see this book in the Vine program. I love Gabby's upbeat, positive, yet no-nonsense and very realistic voice. She tells it like it is, breaking down her lessons, and her life, into small meaningful chapters which pull the reader in and carry him or her through to the lesson and the meaning. This book isn't the ""pollyanna think and you'll be happy"" refrain that some authors offer. Instead, Gabby brings you into the harsh light of day, giving real life examples to the lessons, and honestly, and sometimes painfully sharing aspect of her life which a lesser person might have kept hidden.

Gabby is an inspiration to all of us spirit junkies out there, the meaning to keep trying and carry on, yet she challenges the reader to change, to look at her life in a new way, and in the end, Spirit Junkie will take the reader on a journey of introspection, transformation, and love."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased this lightweight wonder from Big Lots for a great price. My 503 sq ft apartment, which has hardly any closet space, is too small for a heavy duty large vacuum. This vacuum is very easy to put together with only 2 pieces that go on to make it a complete upright vacuum. (No tools needed!)

OK but my SHARK NAVIGATOR LIGHT IS BETTER!
1. I cut my hair weekly with clippers and hair is either on the countertop or tile floors. The handheld got my countertops hair free and my tile floors were quickly cleaned.
2. The pet hair (white/brown shih tzu's long hair) was picked up in 1 swipe on kitchen tile floor, which usually takes me forever with my broom to get up.
3. The crevice attachment is amazing to clean windowsills, crown molding ledges, ceiling fan blades, and those spider webs in those hard to reach corners. Yes, my Spring cleaning began as soon as I purchased this cheap but helpful vac!
4. Cleans carpets as an upright but you will have to go over spots several times to get it squeaky clean and the suction is good enough to leave carpet lines.) By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!
2. Made of cheap plastic but what do I expect for $20!
3. No storage cup for the crevice attachment, but Velcro does wonders!
4. Needs a brush roll to get thru thick carpet!"

Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.
This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it."

It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This is not my first Barbie Dream House.  In fact, I own this exact same one from about 3 years ago.  The design is the same, but the colors are brighter and the pictures have changed a bit to reflect the movies.

The unit shipped with two parts broken that will require them to replace the entire unit.  We'll see how they handle that and I'll update my review.  It is also missing two pieces.  And when I looked back at my old dreamhouse I found that two things that were broken on this one were broken on that one two and I just never noticed that they were supposed to light up (the fridge light and the fireplace light).

The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.

The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.

The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.

For fun I would give this product many stars.  The kids enjoy playing with it. It is big, pink, has Barbie and fits Barbie sized dolls.  I would recommend this overall but know that it is not quite as sturdy as it can be."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it works despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Private Investigator V.I. Warshawski receives a call from her old high school basketball coach, Mary Ann McFarlane who has been sidelined with cancer. She wants V.I. to help her coach 4 hours a week. V.I. takes on the job and is drawn into the lives of her players.

Josie Dorrado's mother Rose begs her for help as the factory where she works has been sabotaged. Frank Zamar, the factory owner, is angry with V.I., and refuses her help as he is obviously terrified of something.

V.I.'s private life is also in turmoil. The man in her life, Morrell, an investigative reporter, is at home recovering from a serious gunshot wound; and Marcena Love, an attractive and gutsy colleague, is staying with him. Marcena is trying to come up with a story on South Chicago and uses V.I.'s work with the basketball team as a way to get to know people. She ends up getting very close to the player's fathers.

The team needs a real coach, a new gym floor and equipment, so V.I. begins to search for corporate sponsors. She meets the grandson of the famous Bill Bysen, the head of a large conservative huge department store chain called By-Smart. Unlike his family, Billy is an idealist that can see how his family's business practices are harming the neighborhood. Billy brings the pastor of the South Chicago church where he is working to preach at the company headquarter's morning prayer meeting. This really antagonizes the family when the preacher lectures them on their responsibility to the poor and the community.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"this coffee maker is great for families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.
OVERALL, GREAT VALUE FOR THE MACHINE...GREAT LOOK, GREAT FILTERS, GREAT CAPABILITIES! 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE LEAK ISSSUE THAT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK TO GET OVER..AND ALSO SIZE. OTHERWISE, PERFORMANCE DESERVES 5 STARS!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,CG,"I installed this switch in a standard garage door opener. I chose this one because I was just starting to get into the garage. The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic.

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The dock works great, and it clears up a lot of space on my desk at work. I have this connected to a 28"" 4k monitor, so the desk is nice and minimalistic with plenty of computer workspace to get work done.

My only complaint with this dock is the length of the extension cables coming out of the dock. They are simple pass-through cables, letting you plug your device cables into the ports on your macbook without needing to take apart the dock every time you need to change a cable. For things like USB, its perfect. However, the cables are all 2+ feet long. It is excessive. The thick bunch of white cables coming out of the back of the dock is difficult to manage and keep out of the way. I would have preferred to have cables only a few inches long, so that I can plug my cables in close to the back of the dock."

I'll just say this topic isn't my cup of tea but the stories were a little better fleshed out than some I've read with at least some personal background on the characters and a little plot. Another good part was that each one can stand alone but except for the first one they continue with some of the same characters and main location of The Key Club. There must be another book that follows or another set since I was left wondering about The Key Club owner and whether she ever finds her match. I also found myself invested quickly in several of the female characters and how they deal or dealt with past issues or tramas but like I said the whole mnage thing is not my cup of tea or any party of my personality fantasies but interesting, I guess, to read about.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"For background, by trade I'm a professional mechanic, so I'm able to follow directions fairly easily.  This had myself and my father scratching our heads quite a bit.  The directions clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole.  Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minutes of brain storming trying to interpret the directions.  They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step.  For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those parts go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) goes on left side.""  Seriously.

Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture looks and how the description cleverly talks about it being shatter proof.  It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond as a plastic backboard does when a ball hits it.  Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

Overall, it's an improvement over the plastic (water filled) smaller version we had that blew over in the wind, but honestly I expected better.  I only bought it online because I live in a small town and knew it would cost far more to buy it locally."

I think the two are the same size, and I'm not sure if that's because I'm smaller than the other, or because it's not just the bumper.

The story itself is good with lots of turns and I was left guessing MANY times. This was not a predictable mystery which I really liked and which made me keep wanting to read to know what happened. I felt it did have a couple dry parts or parts that SEEMED repetitive, but those parts were quickly redeemed. I would highly recommend this book."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,CG,"I have gotten more of this than I thought I would. I also have the Clue. If you want to get a solid idea of the game, you can get it here. I have heard that the game is very similar to the one I played. The Clue is a great way to get familiar with the concept of the game. It has all the different pieces that you can see in the game and you can play with a group of people. The game is played by a group of people, but the game is about a group of people playing a game. It is more like a group of people playing a game. The game is fairly simple, but the basic rules are simple enough for you to understand. I think it is a good game to play with the group of people who are going to play. You can't really mess things up with the people who are going to play with you, but the people who are going to play with you will get bored of it very quickly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game to play with friends or family. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is not going to get bored with the game at first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it! She is obsessed with the piano and loves it! It's a great size for her hands and her head! It's really cute and she loves it."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock for safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.  Seriously... made me laugh almost every time.  And not because he was being intentionally funny."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am a writer, and the room where I work is always colder in winter than the rest of the house. I got tired of wrapping myself up like a Christmas present in order to keep warm while working. Heat Storm to the rescue!

Pros:
Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally.
LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved
Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying
Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low)
Comes pre-set at 70F, but the settings can be easily adjusted
Does not have a ""hot smell"" odor when in use (at least so far)
Best of all, it does indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently.  The manufacturer says it will heat up to 1000 square feet.  My room is larger than that, and it heats the area just fine.

Update:  The more I use this heater, the more I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six feet away from my work area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely.

Description of how an infrared heater works, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions):
""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat waves heat the body and objects of the room directly. The heat stays evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heaters heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heats you.""

Cons:
None so far

I have only had this heater for a short time, so its long-term durability is still unknown.  Very happy with this product so far!"

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Large Canvas Duffel

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are great patches they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber.  I use them on my AR.  However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring as it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit.  First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod.  The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out.

They say you can use each cloth 6 times but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the inserts get opened up and lose integrity and it makes it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened as well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out.

I've since become a master of these patches and have used over 65....  meaning I've done about 3 times the swipes or like 200 swipes through my rifles.

I recommend the smaller 2 inch patches as they are less likely to get stuck but these are still great.  I always pinch close to the inserts and never use a flimsy patch. I always give it a nice tug to make sure it won't fall off.  I also always check how big it clumps up at the base.  It should feel like a tiny pebble or whatever. Mind you the bullet that goes through the barrel has a small diameter."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Hackneyed with sparse flashes of inspiration would be my synopsis of this title. The author's work is a broad-stroke pastiche of stock types stitched together with boilerplate. The action scenes are well put together, but the whole book starts to feel repetitive, largely because of the ""tell not show"" style. The author is at pains to throw out hints of a larger world, but nothing seems to gel. The character names, seemingly ripped from a child's daydream, are particularly jarring if you're trying to take any of this seriously. Feels kind of like Neil Gaiman's stuff does in his lesser works, forced and unsatisfying."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these as a gift for my 20 year old son.  He is notoriously hard to buy shoes for.  Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book contains 90% very accurate descriptions of characters and personality of the 12 chinese signs x the 12 western signs. I got this book many years ago, and it is accurate when I read her readings for my father, sisters and friends. I would say I find her description to be 90% accurate, I think the 10% deviation may be factoring in environmental influence (eg. if she says this person likes to dress up or vain, but sometimes if the person is brought up in a family or culture that doesn't support that, or if the person is not physically attractive, they may do the reverse from low self-esteem etc). But nonetheless, her description of people's personality and character is usually very spot on.

I used her book to read several of my girlfriends, it is incredible. The ones Suzzane say that are loving, kind natured, nice,- they are indeed very nice and loving! The ones she says are cheerful and humourous- they are indeed those who like to laugh and joke! She said my father's sign is a 'born winner', she is right too, for my dad worked from a job of a teacher to become a multi-millionaire investor and director.

One of them is disdainful towards any kind of scratching post -- but the other has ripped through several of the inexpensive $9 throw-away boxes. In fact there are at least two or three of them spread through the house, not counting the little crunchies left behind from enthusiastic scratching.

When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.

Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.

Fortunately as other reviewers have reported, it's constructed very well, with the cardboard FAR more dense than in the cheap scratching boxes you're thinking of. I won't need to replace this for a good long time."

At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!

Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Just what my son wanted. This is a good quality jacket. I purchased it a size larger than what my son wears so he can hopefully get two years out of it. We live in a south Alabama and the winters aren't harsh, but this allows rom for layering. He can wear it daily or for hunting which is great.

The jacket comes very stiff, but softened up after washing once. After a few more washed I feel that it will mold even better. It is insulated and fairly thick. It is perfect for low temperatures with layers underneath. The zipper works great and we haven't experienced any issues with this jacket. It looks just like the picture!

My son picked this jacket out himself (he is 12) and I am very pleased with his selection."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my wife. She hates learning new electronics and is quite picky about things like this. She loves it! First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately. So far my wife and I have been very impressed with it and she does not miss her favorite watch it replaced."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

They fit well though, and are comfortable.  I wish the material was a little thicker, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and stick with four stars as long as they hold out."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"My 25 year old tripod broke, so I purchased this.  Actually, I liked it so much I purchased two of them and gave one to my father.  This is much nicer than my previous tripod.  The tripod has a very ""finished"" look to it and appears to be a very quality product.  The design of it makes it very flexible allowing you to position your camera just about any way you can immagine.  It comes with a nice carry bag, its fairly light weight - without that cheap feeling to it, and it is very compact when fully collapsed.

I have not experienced any problems while using the tripod.  It is stable and there is no creep in the head when the camera is mount in any position.

I believe for many photographers this tripod would be more than suited for them.  While it looks like a well made tool, I'm not sure it would take much in the way of any abuse.  If you need something rugged, this may not be what you are looking for.

Overall, I'm really happy with this product and would recommend it."

Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"UPDATE#2 The tape that is used is not what I'm used to calling VHB. Dropped my hard hat last night and two holders popped off. Do not recommend.  UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

The good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you. If you have a Gmail account, you'll love it even more with the way it integrates your account with everything made by Google.

Another down side is the top cap, it's more like a hard plastic so if you happen to drop it, the handle loop might break off or the whole top cap might break.  They should of used a softer plastic for the top cap, IMHO.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"This is my third pair of Dickies brand work pants. Two of the three pairs - in different styles, have similar problems.

I'm about 5'7"", 125 lbs and the size 4 is the right size for me. Unfortunately, in Dickies' carpenter style, the waist is higher and wider than their cargo workpant style. I have wide hips and a small waist, so after purchasing a pair of the cargo pants and liking the style and fit, I was disappointed when I tried these on. These pants ride higher and looser in the waist than other Dickies.

Other reviewers have stated how rugged the material is. I would add the caveat that it's rugged--by Women's clothing standards. This isn't fashion attire, but it isn't the heavy duck cloth typical in many Men's work pants, either. I can't speak to the working conditions of other people, but I work in a factory alongside men and the work I perform puts the same strains on my clothes - it would be nice if my clothes could last as long. These pants are new, so we'll see.

These pants had frayed seams right out of the bag. I examined the seams closely, and it appears to be cosmetic (the fringe of the under-layer of fabric didn't lay quite right when the crotch seams were stitched) - not structural. As this is the second pair I've gotten with seam problems, I'd say Dickies has a quality control problem.

Pros:
Good quality materials
Good length and style
Rear pockets big enough for my wallet

Cons:
Material could be more rugged
Inconsistent sizing across styles
Poor assembly at seams - fraying sewn in at crotch"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Nine years ago, Alex Delaware successfully treated Melissa Dickinson, a tormented and phobic young girl, irrationally scared of almost everything. After two years of treatment, Melissa seems almost totally recovered, so her need for Dr Delaware ceases, and she becomes one of his most spectacular triumphs. Now, Melissa contacts Alex again, this time seeking advice concerning her mother. Gina Dickinson is a recluse, an ex-actress hiding away from the world ever since a vicious acid attack that left her scarred for life, even after extensive and traumatic plastic surgery. Even though Gina is now seeing, with some effect, a psychiatrist of her own, Melissa wants to know if Alex feels her mother could cope if she went away, accepting her place Harvard. Then, one day, Gina inexplicably climbs into her car, and drives off into thin air, leaving a tangled mystery to be unravelled in her wake.
I had started to think that this series was in danger of going stale. The prose is adequate and easy to read, but hardly full of spirit and at times seems a little perfunctory, and Alex Delaware has also remained a rather static - if very likeable - character. But now, after reading Kellerman's excellent standalone ""The Butcher's Theatre"", I returned to the series with ""Private Eyes"", and found it a wonderfully invigorating experience. This may be his lone of his longest Delaware books to date, but every word is fascinating, and there seems to me to be fresh fire in the writing. The characters are all very well developed, and although Kellerman never really takes any risks with his well-structured plot, it's a complex and clever book that really kicks the brain into gear, and presents one or two nice surprises along the way.
The psychology is dead-on, the relationships are all fascinating, the characterisation is acute, and the resolution is exciting, well-done, and satisfying. This may well turn out to be the rock of the Delaware series. To find out, i shall have to read on..."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I was cleaning out some boxes of children's books, keeping what I consider classic while giving the rest to my grandchildren or to the libraries. I doubled-back between this current edition and the previous editions to make sure this was the same one...it is, and I highly recommend this. I took a class in children's literature back in the 70's and I fondly remember it as being one of the most enjoyable classes I had in college the first time around. This book lasted through my children's growing up and is now going through new useage with my grandchildren. I love the way this book is organized. If you have a child with specific interests such as limericks (and I know few children who don't get a kick out of limericks) you can go to that section without delay.
I grew up with Joan Walsh Anglund poignant drawings. They are not particularly 'great' art, but for children and in this book, they are vastly more suitable than the poorly drawn and maddening stuff put out in cartoons (especially of the Pokemon variety which will set off seizures in children). They say the age of this book is for four years to eight year olds. That isn't true. Every parent should try to take the time to read to all children in whatever form necessary...and it should start at age one. Reading aloud (or signing books) to your children not only makes essential bonds, but it also teaches children what you think is important, and also teaches them how to stop and pay attention. The massive complaints about restless children and the abuse of labeling (ADD/ADHD) has its beginnings in simple things such as turning the television/computers off and reading to your children.
... should be showing the pictures and pages of this book in a sampling, so that parents can make informed decisions about children's books. If you only get one child's book this year, get this one and sit down with your children and read.

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"be mindful that they provide one tube, but ask you to cut it to provide the length required for two ports.  There was no point in the directions for it to tell you to cut to length for the first tube, when in fact, if you cut too long, it meant your outlet port is too short.  Shame on Fluval for cheapening out on this crucial piece for a 100+ dollar equipment."

Seriously, either this was created by a machine and boxed by a machine, or the person who packed it doesnt give a darn. I will change the number of stars if someone can ship the missing piece.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,"I enjoyed the first book, but the second one just wasn't as good. I was just starting to get into the story. The characters were interesting, but not the same as the first book. I still liked the first book, but it was a little slow to get into the story. I'm not a fan of the second book, but the first book was so good. I liked the ending, but I'm not sure if I will be reading the rest of the series. I did like the first book, but I will probably read the third. I was given this book by the author for an honest review. I love the way this author writes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.

Overall, this collar is a great collar for the price.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a dog that has had a lot of separation anxiety.

If you have a dog who is on a very high-stress and stressful schedule, this collar is a good option.  I would recommend it for anyone with a dog that has separation anxiety.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I read the first two books quite some time ago and really enjoyed them. The third has been on my TBR list ever since. I'm glad I finally got to read it and finish Sebastian and Talia's story. The series was action packed with a fair amount of steamy sex. The mystery behind  Sebastian and Talia's past slowly unravels and there is danger at every corner. The couple find themselves in an on again/off again relationship but the feeling remain. Once again, Sebastian comes to Talia's rescue and they finally begin to start trusting each other and secrets are finally out in the open. All this happens while yet there is another threat against Talia's life. The series was fast paced and has a HEA."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Y'all. This cat litter. It's awesome. I was having issues with every litter we tried because it just STUNK. Even when it was fresh and just poured, the fragrance was absolutely horrendous. It just made cat poop smell poopier, if that's even possible. I'd gag every time I'd walk by. I took a chance and bought this, based on the other reviews and being ""fragrance free"". I am more than happy to say, it truly is. I can't even tell we have a cat. There's zero smell. Zero. Even when it needs to be cleaned. Zero. If that's what you're looking for, get this."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"It looks nice, seems to be well made.. keep in mind,  most cats will still be able to get their claws under these and rip the feeding tube out if you do not use bandaging under it.. (Just my opinion and experience)  I wish these were made taller so they covered the whole neck top to bottom.

But they are nice and it worked well to help manage the feeding tube.  I have several of them :)

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"This was my first read for this author.  The story itself was fantastic, an excellent whodunit.  I really loved some of the characters.  There were definitely surprises throughout which I thoroughly enjoyed.  What didn't I like about this book?  The intimate scenes were almost painful, very hokey.  I would love to read more from this author, but would have to skip over the ""sizzling"" scenes as they just make me cringe."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Having been a fan of both Rosanne's work from her 1st album to ""River and The Thread"", I found her memoir fascinating. It is one of those can't put it down page Gardner's, haven't read a book so fast in years. I loved her beautiful way with words, her writing is wonderful and so touching. I loved her fierce love of both her Mother Vivian, her Father John & her Stepmother June ring so true. If you're a fan or if you just want to read her lovely gift with language & her journey as a writer, get this book now! For those of you double nickels like me & Rosanne it's a great look back, especially if you're a California Girl too! I haven't lived in So Cal since age 20, but I sure do remember the rattles, scorpions & tarantula's. She is as mindful of her privacy as always, and gracious in her story telling of life through her eyes, an admirable quality. This is not a mean spirited tell all, it's a gift to all who love great writing, her story of telling Johnny her ""New chapter"" she improvised is just so moving. I hope she hurries with her ""more to come"", I can't wait to read more from her!<3"

If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade.
